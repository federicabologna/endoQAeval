Repository for "Evaluation of GPT-4 for Patient Question Answering about Endometriosis"

**Objective**
To investigate the information quality, empathy, and actionability of GPT-4 responses to patient questions regarding endometriosis, a stigmatized and understudied condition. We combine physician and patient perspectives.

**Materials and Methods**
We prompt GPT-4 with posts from r/Endo and r/endometriosis, and from r/AskDocs. We recruit 3 patients who suffer from endometriosis and an endometriosis specialist to evaluate the information quality, empathy, and actionability of GPT-4 responses to endometriosis and general medical questions. For each endometriosis question, we use three prompting strategies. We then analyze and compare the quality of the responses across the two sets of questions, question types, and different prompting strategies.

**Results**
We find great disagreement across our annotators regarding the quality of answers to both general and endometriosis questions, despite the annotation task closely resembling and following annotation guidelines established in previous studies.

**Discussion**
More research is needed to determine what criterias and annotation guidelines are most effective to evaluate the quality of answers to medical questions. Furthermore, new annotation strategies are needed in order to incorporate patient perspectives in the evaluation of generated models for clinical purposes.
