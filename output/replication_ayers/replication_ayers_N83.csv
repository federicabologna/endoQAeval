N83,response_2,"given your symptoms, you may possibly have a condition called pilonidal sinus or cyst. it occurs in the crease between the buttocks, near the tailbone, and may cause severe pain and swelling. it can also leak blood or pus. it often requires medical treatment, including antibiotics or sometimes even surgical intervention, to heal.

however, it would be crucial for you to get examined by a physician. self-diagnosis may not always be accurate and your condition needs to be evaluated properly to ensure appropriate treatment. 

in the meantime, over-the-counter pain medication and warm baths may offer some relief. but these measures will not treat the underlying problem, so you should see a healthcare provider as soon as possible.

this condition is not typically a cause for extreme worry, but it does require professional medical attention.

(note: please take this advice as only informative and kindly reach out to a health care professional for proper diagnosis and treatment.)"
N83,response_3,"you should definitely get this examined by a doctor. i recommend going to urgent care or an er if you cannot get into your primary doctor in a timely fashion. this could potentially be a perirectal abscess that may need to be drained, or it could be a pilonidal cyst which is a skin infection that occurs at the top of the buttocks in the cleft over the tailbone. the blood could be from hemorrhoids or small tears in the anus called anal fissures which is also worth getting checked out. it's not something to take lightly especially since you're in so much pain. don't wait for this to go away on its own, especially with your symptoms persisting for 6 days already. it's better to be safe and get it checked soon. please note this advice is intended to be general in nature, you should contact your healthcare provider for accurate information."
N83,response_4,"pain with swelling in the tailbone area along with intermittent bleeding can be suggestive of a condition referred to as a pilonidal cyst, an abscess or infection in the cleft at the top of the buttocks. the cyst itself can be caused by a build-up of dead skin cells and hair that create an inflammatory response in the body. 

it's also possible that you could have developed an anal fissure which is a small tear in the lining of the anus, leading to the pain and bleeding you described. this can happen from passing large or hard stools.

either way, it is very important that you get medical attention as soon as possible. both pilonidal cysts and anal fissures can get worse if untreated. a healthcare provider will be able to perform a physical exam and may order diagnostic tests to confirm the diagnosis and recommend a treatment plan. this could include antibiotics, pain management, or in some cases surgical intervention.

remember, if the pain becomes unbearable, go to the er immediately as this could indicate a likely infection that needs to be drained. 

in terms of hygiene, regardless of the cause of the issue, it's crucial to maintain cleanliness in the area by regularly washing with a mild soap and water, avoiding irritating toiletries, and changing underwear frequently. avoid touching the inflamed area with your hand to prevent further infection. ensure to clean your hands after using the toilet. 

disclaimer: this advice is intended to be general in nature, and specific causes may not apply to your situation. always consult with a healthcare provider for appropriate diagnosis and treatment."
N83,response_5,"it sounds like you may have a perianal abscess or a pilonidal cyst, both of which can cause swelling, pain, and sometimes bleeding in the tailbone area. they typically don't go away on their own and often require medical treatment which may include antibiotics or surgical drainage. you should definitely get this checked out by a healthcare professional. it's possible that this could get worse if untreated, and there's also a risk that it could be something more serious like a tumor or a fistula. in the mean time, maintain good hygiene and avoid activities that exacerbate the pain. contact your local healthcare provider or go to the emergency room if the pain is severe or you develop fever, chills, or other signs of a systemic infection. do not take this as a medical advice and see a healthcare provider to address your concerns."
N83,response_6,"it's important that you visit a healthcare provider as soon as possible, because the pain, swelling, and bleeding you describe could be signs of several conditions, including a pilonidal cyst (a painful cyst that develops near the tailbone), a perianal abscess (a painful collection of pus near the anus), or an anal fissure (a small tear in the thin, moist tissue that lines the anus).

in the meantime, you can continue to take over-the-counter pain relief medication and use a cushion or pillow to sit on to help relieve pressure on the area. hygiene is crucial, keep the area clean by gently washing with mild soap and warm water and avoid straining when you go to the toilet.

however, these are only temporary solutions and it's critical that you see a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan."
N83,response_7,"the pain and swelling you're describing could be due to a number of conditions, such as an anal fissure, hemorrhoids, or perirectal abscess. additionally, bleeding with bowel movements can commonly be associated with these conditions. it's important that you see a medical professional for evaluation and treatment, especially given the pain and discomfort you're having, the persistence of symptoms, and the presence of bleeding. infection should also be ruled out, particularly since you used a potentially unclean bathroom. in the meantime, aside from the ibuprofen, warm sitz baths might provide some relief. but again, a visit to a healthcare provider is necessary for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan."
N83,response_8,"you definitely need to see a doctor. this could be a number of things such as a pilonidal cyst, an abscess, hemorrhoids, or a fissure. the pain, swelling, and discharge do indicate an infection, which if not treated could worsen and potentially spread.

a pilonidal cyst, for example, occurs at the base of the spine and can be quite painful; it can also lead to an abscess if it becomes infected. hemorrhoids are swollen blood vessels in the rectum or anus that can cause bleeding, itching, and pain. an anal fissure is a small tear in the lining of the anus which can cause pain and bleeding, especially during a bowel movement.

in any case, it's important not only to treat the immediate issue but also to figure out the underlying cause so that it doesn't continue to happen. please, don't wait to see the doctor, as this condition could worsen and even become quite serious if not treated. 

in the meantime, try to keep the area clean and dry, avoid sitting for long periods, and take over-the-counter medication for pain. you should also use moist wipes instead of dry toilet paper to prevent further irritation."
N83,response_9,"this sounds like it could possibly be a pilonidal cyst, which is a small sac that forms at the top of the crease between your buttocks. these cysts can get infected and become very painful - especially when sitting. bleeding is also common if it ruptures. 

the smell you mention could be from infection or from usual anal sweat and fecal matter. the cyst can be a recurrent problem even if it goes away. it's best to get it checked by a doctor for a proper diagnosis and treatment. you may require antibiotics or even drainage procedure if it's indeed a cyst. consider making an appointment soon to prevent any escalation of the issue.

you should maintain strict hygiene to minimize risk of infections. get a gentle cleanser for that area and keep it dry as much as possible. avoid sitting for long periods of time and consider using a pillow or cushion to sit on to lessen the discomfort. 

if the pain and swelling worsens, or if you develop a fever, this could be a more urgent situation needing immediate medical attention."
N83,response_10,"rectal bleeding or blood in your stool can be a symptom of different conditions - some more serious than others. hemorrhoids are usually the most common cause. anal fissures and polyps are other causes. however, given the abrupt onset of pain and swelling, this could potentially be an abscess or a pilonidal cyst. this would explain the discomfort, swelling and foul smell you mention. also, it's not uncommon for a pilonidal cyst to develop in the area you described.

pilonidal cysts can become quite painful and may require professional medical treatment, often medications, drainage or even surgery. medical evaluation would allow for appropriate testing, diagnosis, and treatment planning. 

so yes, it is advisable to see a doctor. ibuprofen is okay for temporary pain relief; over-the-counter stool softeners might help with the pain during bowel movements, but don't delay seeking medical attention."
N83,response_11,"it sounds like you may have a pilonidal cyst, an abscess or a fissure, all of which can cause pain, swelling and sometimes bleeding in the tailbone area. 

a pilonidal cyst is a pocket in the skin that usually contains hair and skin debris. a pilonidal cyst that is not causing symptoms does not need treatment, but a cyst that is causing pain or discomfort should be treated.

an abscess is a collection of pus that has built up within the tissue of the body. abscesses are often painful and warm to the touch, and can sometimes cause fever and malaise. they usually need to be drained and sometimes require antibiotics.

a fissure is a tear or ulcer in the lining of the anal canal, which can cause pain and bleeding, especially during bowel movements. 

these conditions cannot be diagnosed without a physical examination, so it would be important to see a doctor. if there is a lot of pain or discomfort, if there are signs of infection (like fever or chills), or if there is difficulty with bowel movements,  that could be an emergency and you should seek immediate medical attention.

until you see a doctor, avoid anything that could irritate the area, like harsh soaps or wiping too hard. over-the-counter pain medications, like ibuprofen, may be helpful. a warm sitz bath, which is a shallow bath for the buttocks and hips, may also help. but these measures are only for temporary relief and you will need to see a doctor for definitive treatment."
N83,response_12,"one possibility for your symptoms is a pilonidal cyst. this is an abnormal pocket in the skin that usually contains hair and skin debris. it's typically located near the tailbone at the top of the buttocks crease. symptoms can include pain, redness and swelling around the cyst, and draining pus or blood. 

another possibility is an anal fissure, which is a small tear in the tissue that lines the anus. you may experience pain and bleeding with bowel movements.

since you're experiencing severe pain, it would be best to seek medical attention promptly. over-the-counter pain medications can help with the discomfort, but you may need additional treatment depending on the cause of your symptoms. don't try to drain a cyst or a boil yourself, as this can lead to infection. 

generally speaking, you should always seek medical help when you have prolonged rectal bleeding, severe/acute anal pain, and rectal pain that doesn't get better after a bowel movement."
N83,response_13,"this issue could be a potential pilonidal cyst which could be infected (the swelling, pain, odor). the bleeding could be from a nearby hemorrhoid. although, it is important to remember that this is just a guess based on your symptoms and you should see a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment. in some cases, if it is a pilonidal cyst, it can rupture and drain on its own, but in most cases, surgical intervention is necessary. the cyst is not caused by the unclean bathroom, but inflammation and infection could be exacerbated by poor hygiene. over-the-counter pain relievers can help manage the pain in the meantime, but you should seek medical help as soon as possible to prevent potential complications."
N83,response_14,"the symptoms you're describing may be an indication of an abscess or a pilonidal cyst, a relatively common condition in young, hairy men. this occurs when hair burrows into the skin near the tailbone, resulting in pain, swelling, and sometimes infection or abscess. 

however, rectal bleeding is a symptom of concern that can have different causes, ranging from hemorrhoids to more serious conditions such as anal fissures or even colorectal cancer. 

given the presence of swelling, rectal bleeding, and severe pain, you should seek medical attention as soon as possible. if it's an abscess or a pilonidal cyst, it might need to be drained. depending on the location and the extent of the problem, local or general anesthesia may be used. if the issue is more persistent, you may need minor surgery to remove the cyst or abscess.

you should definitely not ignore these symptoms, as if they are left untreated, the condition can become more serious and impact your overall health. 

please note that this advice is based on the symptoms you provided, and that i'm an ai language model. always consult with a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis. i hope you feel better soon."
N83,response_15,"you should definitely see a doctor about your symptoms as soon as possible. the pain you're describing could be from a number of conditions, ranging from relatively minor issues like hemorrhoids to more serious conditions like an abscess or fistula. the presence of blood is another cause for concern. even if it turns out to be something minor, any persistent pain or bleeding should always be evaluated by a medical professional. in the meantime, continue to take over-the-counter pain relievers as necessary and try applying a warm compress to the area to help reduce the swelling and discomfort."
N83,response_16,"this sounds like it could be a perianal abscess or a pilonidal cyst. both conditions can cause pain, swelling, and potential bleeding, and these symptoms could be exacerbated by sitting, pressure, or activity. if it's abscess, it can have bad smell due to the accumulation and subsequent infection of sweat and debris in the area. 
in more severe cases, you may also experience fever, fatigue or have pus coming from the area.

both conditions will need medical attention and potentially surgical drainage, especially if the pain is severe and there seems to be infection (fever or pus). the problem will not go away on its own and would actually worsen: the abscess might rupture which would increase pain and risk of spread of infection, and pilonidal cysts can become chronic and recurrent.

in the meantime, try to keep the area as clean and dry as possible. over-the-counter pain medications can help manage the pain, but please limit the use of ibuprofen or other nsaids as they can cause gastric ulcers if taken for long duration without any stomach protective medicines. 

avoid sitting too long on hard surfaces and see if warm compress can provide some relief.

but please, make an arrangement to see a healthcare provider or go to an emergency department as soon as possible."
N83,response_17,"you should definitely seek medical attention as this could be a perianal abscess, piles (hemorrhoids), or a pilonidal cyst. these are all conditions which all require medical intervention. for instance, a perianal abscess would require incision and drainage, and antibiotics, but you won't know for sure until a healthcare provider evaluates you. avoid touching the area and potentially spreading bacteria. in the meantime, keep the area as clean and dry as you can, try warm compresses, and continue with the ibuprofen for pain relief."
N83,response_18,"you should definitely see a doctor. the fact that the pain and swelling have persisted for 6 days, are severe enough to disrupt normal activities like sitting and lying down, and are not adequately controlled by over-the-counter pain relievers all suggest that something more serious could be going on. conditions that can cause these symptoms and might need to be ruled out include a perianal abscess (a pocket of pus near the anus), a pilonidal cyst (a cyst that develops near the tailbone), or a more serious issue in the lower gastrointestinal tract. the presence of blood on your toilet paper could indicate hemorrhoids, but could also be a sign of a more serious concern like an anal fissure or colorectal cancer. none of this is meant to alarm you unnecessarily or suggest that these are the only possible explanations. however, no one can diagnose you accurately over the internet. you need to make an appointment to see a healthcare provider as soon as possible. in the meantime, try to keep the area clean and dry, and continue taking over-the-counter pain relievers as directed on the package."
N83,response_19,"the symptoms you're experiencing, such as pain, tenderness, and swelling at the bottom of the tailbone, along with the bleeding during bowel movement, suggest a possible issue such as hemorrhoids, anal fissures, or a pilonidal cyst, among other things. 

hemorrhoids and anal fissures typically involve bleeding during bowel movements. but they shouldn't cause pain in the tailbone area or cause a scent. 

a pilonidal cyst, which is a pocket of skin that forms at the tailbone, can be painful and swollen, sometimes smelly, and can cause discomfort when sitting or lying down. if it gets infected, it can be very painful and may drain pus or blood.

in all these cases, it is important that you see a doctor. they can diagnose this issue correctly and prescribe appropriate treatment. feel free to go to the emergency department if the pain is unbearable or if you develop a fever. try not to touch the area too frequently to prevent spreading any possible infection.

your doctor may prescribe antibiotics in case of an infection and painkillers to manage the pain. in some cases, surgical options might be necessary. 

please don't delay seeking medical help."
N83,response_20,"the symptoms you're experiencing are suggestive of a possible anal fissure or a pilonidal cyst - both relatively common conditions. an anal fissure could explain the presence of blood when you wipe after passing stool and typically causes pain. a pilonidal cyst, on the other hand, is an infection that forms a lump near the tailbone. it can cause pain, tenderness, and often has an unpleasant smell.

it is best you go see a doctor about this. while some fissures and cysts may go away on their own, it is not guaranteed, and they often recur if not adequately treated. it's especially important to take action if an infection is present, which may be the case given the smell and swelling you mentioned. a medical professional will be able to correctly identify the condition and prescribe the necessary treatment. in the meantime, continue to manage the pain with over-the-counter medication, but do not delay seeking medical attention."
N83,response_21,"it sounds like you might have a pilonidal cyst. this is an abnormal pocket in the skin that usually contains skin debris and hair. it usually occurs in the the crease between the buttocks, near the tailbone. symptoms may include pain, swelling, and redness. it can also lead to an abscess with pus, which might explain the bad smell. sometimes, a pilonidal cyst can cause bleeding, which might be the explanation for the blood you're seeing when you wipe. it's recommended to see a healthcare provider for proper diagnosis and treatment. over-the-counter pain relief can help manage the discomfort, but in some cases antibiotics or surgery may be needed. ignoring the symptoms could lead to complications like infection. it's unlikely that the use of your friends' non-clean toilet is the cause of your symptoms. pilonidal cysts are more likely to be caused by a combination of changing hormone levels (since they're mostly seen in people in their teens or early 20s), hair growth, and friction from clothes or from sitting a lot."
N83,response_22,"it sounds like you might have a condition called a pilonidal cyst, which is a small sac that can form in the crease of your buttocks. pilonidal cysts can become infected, causing pain, redness, swelling, and sometimes the drainage of pus or blood.

the pain and swelling you're experiencing isn't likely to resolve on its own if it is indeed an infected pilonidal cyst, and the fact that you're smelling a bad odor might suggest that there's an infection present. please seek medical attention as soon as you can. treatment often consists of draining the cyst, and in some cases, antibiotics may be prescribed if an infection is present.

although pilonidal cysts are often blamed on poor hygiene, it's important to note that they can also occur in people who are scrupulously clean. some people appear to be predisposed to developing them, perhaps due to a combination of hair type (curly or coarse) and body shape (especially if there's deeper than usual cleft between the buttocks). 

avoid sitting for long periods of time, wear loose-fitting clothing that doesn't put pressure on the area, and keep the area clean and dry. please do follow up with a healthcare provider to help manage and treat this condition effectively."
N83,response_23,"this could be a pilonidal cyst, a perirectal abscess or potentially a hemorrhoid. both the pain and bleeding you're experiencing are significant symptoms and should be evaluated by a healthcare professional. it's possible you need antibiotics, a procedure to drain the area, or other treatments. over-the-counter pain remedies like ibuprofen can help with pain and inflammation in the short term, but it's important to find and treat the underlying cause of your symptoms. avoid placing your fingers near the area to avoid spreading bacteria and wash your hands thoroughly after using the toilet. it's unlikely it will go away on its own and leaving it untreated could lead to more serious problems. please seek medical attention."
N83,response_24,"it sounds like you might have a pilonidal cyst, which is an infection in the crease of your buttocks near the tailbone. these cysts can sometimes form after prolonged sitting, pressure, irritation or hair penetration. they often become painful and swollen, and can sometimes rupture and cause bleeding or emit a foul smell. it is unlikely to disappear on its own and needs medical intervention. regular pain medication and home care can be helpful to manage the symptoms, but do not eliminate the condition.

likewise, rectal bleeding can be concerning and should always be evaluated by a healthcare provider. a small amount of bright red blood can be due to an anal fissure or hemorrhoids, which are common and usually not dangerous. but it can also be a sign of more serious conditions, such as colorectal cancer, especially if accompanied with other symptoms like changes in bowel habits or unexplained weight loss.

given your symptoms, you should contact your healthcare provider as soon as possible. to prevent further complications, pilonidal cysts usually require a minor surgical procedure to drain the pus and remove the hair or debris. your healthcare provider may also prescribe antibiotics to fix it if it also infected. in general, keep the area clean and avoid unnecessary pressure are important to prevent recurrence. 

this advice is intended to be general in nature, and specific causes may not apply to your situation. always consult with a healthcare provider for appropriate examination, testing and care recommendations."
N83,response_25,"you should definitely seek medical attention right away. you may have a condition called a pilonidal cyst, which is a pocket in the skin that often contains hair and skin debris located near your tailbone at the top of the cleft of your buttocks. they can cause pain, redness, swelling, and can sometimes become infected. this could explain the blood, smell, and discomfort you've been experiencing. in severe cases it may need to be removed by a procedure. please see a healthcare provider as soon as possible to get this checked and don't ignore the symptoms. a course of antibiotics might be needed if it's inflamed or infected. over the counter pain relief such as ibuprofen can help with the pain but doesn't treat the root cause."
