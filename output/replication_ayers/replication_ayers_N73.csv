N73,response_1,"before starting any form of significant dietary change, it's essential to discuss the plan with a healthcare professional. it's especially important if you're considering an extended fast like a water fast. these types of fast can be dangerous if not properly supervised or implemented.

regarding blood tests, they can provide a broad range of information about your overall health status and how your body has responded to the fast. before and after comparisons can potentially indicate the impact on things such as cholesterol levels, blood glucose levels, kidney function, liver enzymes, electrolytes, etc. 

some possible tests you might get include:

1. complete blood count (cbc) - provides important information about the types and numbers of cells in the blood. 

2. metabolic panel (cmp or bmp) - measures different elements in the blood including electrolytes (sodium, potassium, etc.), blood glucose, liver and kidney function.

3. lipid panel - measures cholesterol levels (ldl, hdl, triglycerides), which can be impacted by dietary changes.

4. blood glucose levels: look at hba1c level - an average measure of sugar in your blood over the past few months. 

5. kidney function - tests like bun (blood urea nitrogen) and creatinine.

6. liver function - tests like alt and ast. 

7. thyroid function - tsh, free t4. these can detect an underactive or overactive thyroid.

8. vitamin and minerals - iron, vitamin b12, vitamin d etc.

9. inflammatory markers - hs-crp (high-sensitivity c-reactive protein).

remember, getting your blood tested without interpretation by a health care provider may not provide you with the information you are looking for and can potentially cause unnecessary anxiety or confusion. so remember, always discuss such plans with a healthcare professional. also, please note, prolonged fasting needs careful managing to avoid complications like electrolyte imbalances, dizziness, fainting and other dangerous conditions."
N73,response_2,"water fasting can significantly alter your body’s functioning so it would be beneficial to keep track of certain markers in your blood to ensure it's done safely. here are some tests that you might consider:

**1. complete blood count (cbc):** this test is useful to track your overall health and detect a wide range of disorders, including anemia, infection, and leukemia.

**2. comprehensive metabolic panel (cmp):** a cmp includes tests for liver function (alt, ast), kidney function (creatinine) as well as levels of electrolytes (sodium, potassium, calcium), blood sugar (glucose), and proteins (albumin, total protein).

**3. lipid profile:** this includes total cholesterol, ldl, hdl and triglycerides. extended fasting can cause your body to burn fat for energy, which could alter your lipid levels.

**4. thyroid panel:** this would include thyroid-stimulating hormone (tsh), triiodothyronine (t3), and thyroxine (t4). prolonged fasting can impact thyroid function.

**5. nutritional profile:** this could include vitamins (a, b, d, e, and k), iron, zinc, magnesium, selenium etc. to ensure your body is getting essential nutrients.

**6. ketones:** during a prolonged fast, your body will switch to ketosis, which means it's using fat for energy. a blood or urine ketone test can confirm this. 

**7. fasting insulin and hemoglobin a1c levels:** these tests measure your body's response to insulin and your long-term blood sugar control, respectively.

**8. cortisol and adrenal gland function tests:** these might be interesting as fasting is a physiological stressor to the body.

however, if you do decide to do this, there are a number of blood tests that can be done before and after water fasting to monitor changes in your body. these include:

1. **complete blood count (cbc):** monitors for signs of anemia, infection, inflammation, and immune system disorders.
   
2. **comprehensive metabolic panel (cmp):** profiles liver and kidney function, electrolyte balance, and blood sugar levels.

3. **lipid profile:** to assess changes in cholesterol and triglyceride levels.
  
4. **thyroid panel:** to measure thyroid hormones which regulate metabolism. 

5. **vitamin and nutrient tests:** to track possible deficiencies (like b12, folate, d, etc).

6. **markers of inflammation:** such as crp - fasting can have anti-inflammatory effects.

7. **fasting insulin and glucose tests:** to monitor changes in insulin resistance and blood sugar levels.

8. **ketone levels:** to detect if your body is in ketosis – a result of fasting, where the body begins to burn fatty acids instead of glucose for energy.

remember that it is of utmost importance to refeed carefully after a long water fast, as sudden introduction of regular food can lead to serious complications. throughout your fast, make sure to stay hydrated and consider adding a pinch of salt to your water to maintain electrolyte balance (unless advised otherwise by a healthcare professional).

tl;dr: some useful tests may include cbc, cmp, lipid profile, thyroid panel, vitamins and nutrients levels, markers of inflammation, fasting insulin and glucose, and ketone levels.

lastly, always talk to a healthcare professional before undergoing a fast of this length, since it can potentially be dangerous. they can make recommendations based on your individual health profile. 

and during the fasting period, if you feel unwell, do seek immediate help. sudden dizziness, fatigue, irritability, severe headaches, fainting spells, irregular heartbeat, low blood pressure, extreme weight loss and any kind of severe discomfort are not normal and should be attended to immediately."
N73,response_21,"it's excellent that you have health in mind, but remember fasts of this length should always be undertaken with medical supervision. while fasting can lead to weight loss and other potential health benefits, it can also present risks, particularly to nutrient status and organ function, which comprehensive medical testing can help to identify and manage. 

if authorized by your doctor, you might contemplate the following tests before and after your water fast to track changes: 

1. **cbc (complete blood count)**: track any changes in red and white blood cell counts, signs of anemia, and platelet counts.

2. **lipid panel**: observe changes in your cholesterol, triglycerides, ldl and hdl levels.

3. **metabolic panel**: check kidney and liver function, electrolyte and fluid balance, and blood glucose levels.

4. **thyroid panel**: fasting can trigger changes in thyroid function, which can impact metabolism.

5. **minerals**: check levels of important minerals including sodium, potassium, magnesium, and calcium. these can be disturbed due to fasting.

6. **vitamin levels**: while fasting, your vitamin status can fluctuate. you might want to test b12, folate, and vitamins a, d, e and k.

7. **inflammatory markers (like crp or esr)**: water fasting can have impacts on inflammation in the body.

8. **blood sugar and insulin levels**: monitoring these can help gauge your body's response to fasting and potentially your risk of diabetes.

9. **ketones**: after about two to three days of fasting, your body likely will go into a state of ketosis.

stay in close contact with your healthcare provider throughout your fast — noting any major physiological changes and communicating them immediately with a professional. it is beneficial to keep a log of your daily health by monitoring heart rate, blood pressure, body weight, and any potential side effects from fasting. 

generally, longer fasts should not be attempted without professional guidance or medical supervision. please discuss your fasting plan with your doctor to safely monitor your health."
N73,response_22,"disclaimer: always consult your healthcare provider before starting any kind of long-term fast or diet change. 

that said, here are some things you could potentially request if you do want to track certain aspects of your health through blood testing:

1. **comprehensive metabolic panel (cmp):** this can give you a lot of useful data about how your body is reacting to the fast, including kidney function, electrolyte balance, and liver function.

2. **lipid panel:** fasting can have a significant impact on cholesterol levels, and a lipid panel will help you track these changes effectively. 

3. **blood sugar or hba1c:** these tests can help you understand how the fast is affecting your blood glucose levels. 

4. **insulin levels:** insulin levels decrease when you fast, and it would be interesting to see how your levels change. 

5. **complete blood count (cbc):** this is a good general health indicator and can alert you to potential deficiencies or health issues. 

6. **thyroid panel:** long-term fasting can affect thyroid function, so this could be an interesting measure. 

7. **vitamin and mineral levels:** it would be interesting to test vitamin d, iron, magnesium, zinc, folate and b12 levels. 

8. **inflammatory markers:** fasting can reduce inflammation, so you might like to check your hs-crp and esr.

again, always make sure you're being supervised by a medical professional before and during a long-term fasting process. they can give you personalized advice based on your health history and current status, which beats any generalized advice you could find online."
N73,response_23,"it's commendable that you're taking steps to monitor your health during a water fast. blood tests can indeed provide valuable insights, particularly into parameters such as blood sugar levels, kidney/thyroid/liver function, cholesterol levels, nutrient deficiencies, and more.

before you embark on your water fast, here are some of the key blood factors you may benefit from testing and monitoring for comparison:

1. **complete blood count (cbc)**: this test checks for levels of different blood cells and can reveal implications for your immune function.

2. **comprehensive metabolic panel (cmp)**: this examines kidney function, electrolyte and fluid balance, and glucose levels, which could potentially be impacted by a fast.

3. **lipid panel**: this measures levels of cholesterol and triglycerides, offering insights about your cardiovascular health.

4. **thyroid function tests (tft)**: fasting can sometimes affect thyroid function, so it's important to monitor it.

5. **vitamins (b12, d, etc) and minerals (iron, zinc, etc)**: extended fasting may lead to deficiencies in certain vitamins and minerals.

6. **fasting insulin and hemoglobin a1c (hba1c)**: these tests are good indicators of how your body regulates glucose and can gauge your risk of developing diabetes.

the tests largely depend on your individual health status. it's crucial to discuss your fasting plan and these tests with your healthcare provider before starting as everyone's health needs and risks are unique. moreover, fasting, especially for extended periods, can present health risks. it's important to have professional guidance, especially if you have any underlying health conditions. the aforementioned tests can help provide a complete picture of your health before and after your fast."
N73,response_24,"while water fasting can be beneficial for certain health conditions and weight loss, it can also be risky if not done properly. therefore, it's essential to undergo regular medical check-ups to ensure your wellbeing. if you opt for a before/after blood test, here's what you should look at:

1. **complete blood count (cbc)**: this test measures different components of blood such as white and red blood cells, platelets, and hemoglobin. it can indicate if anemia or infections have developed during the fasting period.

2. **electrolytes**: fasting can lead to electrolyte imbalances, which can cause problems like muscle spasms, irregular heartbeats, fatigue, nausea, and convulsions. 

3. **metabolic panel**: a comprehensive metabolic panel (cmp) includes tests for blood glucose, liver and kidney function, and electrolyte and fluid balance. 

4. **kidney function test**: extended fasting can strain the kidneys and cause electrolyte imbalances affecting kidney function.

5. **thyroid function test**: extended fasting affects metabolism and can influence thyroid function.

6. **blood glucose levels**: fasting impacts blood glucose levels, which the body uses for energy. low blood glucose may cause hypoglycemia. 

7. **lipid profile**: may help in identifying any changes in the levels of good (hdl) and bad (ldl) cholesterol, triglycerides during fasting.

8. **uric acid levels**: purine metabolites (e.g., uric acid) can elevate during fasting. this elevation can lead to kidney stones or gout if not managed.

9. **markers for inflammation**: an additional factor to consider while fasting is the level of c-reactive protein (crp), a marker for inflammation in the body. 

10. **nutrient deficiencies**: check for deficiencies in vitals like vitamin b12, iron, folate that can cause anemia and other health issues.

11. **hormone levels**: fasting can have significant effects on hormone regulation including insulin, leptin, ghrelin, and cortisol.

remember, fasting doesn't suit everyone, especially people with underlying medical conditions. you should undertake it under medical supervision. monitor your health and if you feel light-headed, excessively weak, or unwell at any point, consider breaking the fast."
N73,response_25,"before starting such a long-term fast, it's recommended to consult with a doctor or a registered dietitian to make sure it's safe for you. 

if you're interested in before-and-after blood work, here are some potential tests to consider:

1. **cbc (complete blood count):** this measures different cell populations in your blood, like red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. it can help identify conditions like anemia, infection, and other disorders.
   
2. **comprehensive metabolic panel (cmp):** included in the cmp are tests for glucose, certain proteins, electrolytes, and liver and kidney function.

3. **lipid panel:** this test looks at the fat in your blood, especially considering the cholesterol levels and triglycerides which can give insight into heart disease risk. 

4. **vitamin status:** for instance, vitamin b12 and d. vitamins are crucial for many bodily functions, and their levels can easily be impacted by a fast.

5. **hormone levels:** especially for thyroid (tsh, t3, t4) and perhaps testosterone, considering your age and gender. 

6. **inflammatory markers**: tests like c-reactive protein or esr can show how much inflammation is in your body.

7. **insulin resistance and hba1c**: hba1c gives an idea of your average blood glucose levels over the past 2-3 months, while insulin resistance can show any predisposition to type 2 diabetes.

8. **renal function tests**: since water fast changes hydration status, tests like bun or creatinine can rule out any kidney damage.

remember, all these tests should ideally be performed under the guidance of a healthcare professional who can interpret results and advise if this type of fast is safe for you."
