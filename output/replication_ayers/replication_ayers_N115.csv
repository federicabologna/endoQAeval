N115,response_1,"i'm sorry to hear your son is struggling with excess saliva. firstly, i'm a language model ai developed by openai and can provide suggestions based on general knowledge, but these suggestions won't replace the advice of your son's healthcare provider. here are a few alternatives:

1. speech therapy: some patients with dysphagia (difficulty swallowing) find relief from excess saliva by working with a speech therapy professional. they use specific exercises to strengthen the swallowing muscles.

2. use of special devices: a special device like a nebulizer machine may help to clear his secretions. however, you should discuss this with his doctor to ensure it's a good option for him.

3. medication adjustments: some medications can be adjusted to help manage saliva production. please refer to your doctor regarding this, as they would understand whether those medicines are apt for your child's condition.

4. physical techniques: certain positioning techniques, like rolling on his side or raising his head, may help to manage his saliva production.

5. dental care: regular dental checks can also help, as dental issues can often lead to increased salivary flow.

remember that any changes or decisions should be made in consultation with your healthcare provider. also keep in mind each child is different and what works for one child may not work for another."
N115,response_2,"excessive saliva (also known as sialorrhea) can be quite bothersome, especially for children with neuromuscular conditions, like your son. however, there are various treatment options that you might consider. 

1. **pharmacological medicines**: we noticed your son didn't respond well to robinol, but there are other drugs, such as scopolamine patches, which have been found to reduce saliva production.

2. **physical therapy**: physical and occupational therapy can also be used to help improve swallowing in some children. however, this will depend on the severity of your son's condition.

3. **speech therapy**: some children benefit from speech therapy to work on oral control, which can sometimes improve control of saliva.

4. **oral devices**: an orthodontic appliance can help redirect saliva and reduce drooling, when tolerated.

5. **neurosurgery**: as a last resort, some doctors may discuss neurectomy to reduce saliva. however, such procedures should be approached with caution given potential side effects and the child's overall health condition.

it's important that treating physicians also consider any further implications of these treatments, as reducing saliva too much may affect oral health. ultimately, a multi-disciplinary approach involving the pediatrician, ent specialist and neurologist might be needed to comprehensively address this issue. 

please consult your healthcare provider before making any decisions about your child's healthcare management."
N115,response_3,"it sounds like you are dealing with a lot, and i empathize with your situation. the excess saliva is potentially caused by his inability to swallow. while anti-salivary agents and mechanical expectoration methods have been recommended, they are not without their corresponding risks and side effects.

in evaluating the other alternatives, here are some potential options. 

1. anticholinergic medications: these reduce saliva production and can be an option to consider as they come in multiple forms like patches, pills and liquids. one commonly used is called scopolamine. it can potentially reduce secretions, but can also has its own side effects such as dryness, constipation and even causing agitation. so it's definitely something that would need to be closely monitored.

2. botulinum toxin (botox): injecting the salivary glands with botox has been found to be effective in certain cases. however, its effects are temporary and may require frequent injections.

3. glycopyrrolate: it's a medication that reduces the amount of saliva produced but it has similar side-effects like robinul, but some people tolerate it better.

4. surgical interventions such as neurectomy or salivary duct ligation or rerouting could be potential options, though they come with their own set of risks and usually are considered when other options are exhausted.

5. speech/swallow therapies: a speech therapist might help with improving control over swallowing reflex to manage the drooling. 

6. alternative natural methods: some people have found using certain types of pacifiers or flavoured substances like lemon juice can stimulate swallowing. however, these methods are not studied as thoroughly and so may not be as effective. 

it's very important to have an informed discussion, considering all the pros and cons, with your son’s medical team to get the most tailored treatment plan. each child responds differently to treatments, and so there might be some trial and error involved in finding a solution that works best for your son. i hope this was helpful."
N115,response_4,"i'm really sorry to hear about your son's condition. it must be challenging for you as a parent. however, you should consult his healthcare provider before trying alternative treatments as every case is unique and what works for one child may not work for another. 

a few possibilities you could discuss with his doctor are:

1. scopolamine patches: these are typically used to treat motion sickness but can also help to reduce saliva production. they're applied to the skin and gradually release the medication into the body over time.

2. atropine oral drops: these can be added to his saliva to reduce its production. side effects may include dry mouth, blurry vision, and sensitivity to light.

3. neostigmine and pyridostigmine: these medicines work by enhancing communication between nerves and muscles, which may help to control secretions.

4. radiation therapy: a rare and extreme option, this can be used to reduce the size of the salivary glands and therefore reduce the amount of saliva produced.

5. surgical options: if other treatments aren't effective, surgical techniques may be a consideration, such as neurectomy, where the nerves that stimulate saliva production are cut; or duct ligation, where the ducts of the salivary glands are tied or clamped off to reduce saliva flow.

therapies such as chest physical therapy or nebulizer treatments can also help to manage and clear his secretions.

you might also want to consider speaking to a speech-language pathologist. therapy may be available to help manage swallowing and reduce the risk of aspiration.

please discuss these options with his healthcare provider or a specialist in this field, who will have a better knowledge of his medical history and be able to provide more personalized advice. 

please remember, you're doing a great job in caring for your son and both his health and your peace of mind matter."
N115,response_5,"i'm an ai language model, not a doctor, but i can suggest some perspectives you may want to discuss with your child's specialist. keep in mind, you should always consult with a healthcare professional before making any changes to your child's treatment or care.

1. medications: different medications might be used to help reduce the production of saliva, like scopolamine. depending on the severity of the problem, sometimes medication can be adjusted or combined to get the desired effect. always consult with a healthcare professional on potential side effects.

2. physical and speech therapy: these types of therapists can work with your child to improve swallowing and to teach methods for managing excess saliva.

3. surgery: some surgical procedures can help with saliva management, such as a neurectomy or salivary gland duct ligation. these are typically considered only for severe cases.

4. assistive devices: you may want to take a second look at the current assistive devices your child relies on. are they adequately serving his needs? there might be better options available, such as different types of suction machines or mouth accessories.

5. specialist guidance: consider seeking advice from a swallowing specialist, or a neurologist who specializes in movement disorders.

again, please consult with your son’s healthcare provider to review any changes to his care plan and to clarify any other professional advice you receive."
N115,response_6,"i'm very sorry to hear about your son's struggles and i can understand how stressful and challenging this must be for you. 

from a non-medical perspective, possible strategies could include more frequent turning, positional changes, or the use of a soft neck collar to improve his head control and potentially reduce saliva pooling.

however, from a medical perspective, scopolamine patches might be a consideration. they are often used for excessive salivation and work by reducing secretion production, but these too can have side effects such as dry mouth and urinary retention. 

another option could be neostigmine, a medication that could indirectly reduce saliva but this is quite an intense medication and would be a last resort.

a consultation with a pediatric neurologist might be helpful, as they often manage children with significant physical disability and excessive saliva.

i'd also recommend contacting a speech and language therapist, as they may have some strategies for managing salvia production and aspiration. 

of course, any medicine or treatment option should be carefully discussed with your son's primary healthcare provider. they will be best placed to understand his overall condition and tailor treatment plans accordingly.

please note this advice is intended to be general in nature, and specific causes may warrant different approaches to management. always consult with a healthcare provider for appropriate treatment."
N115,response_7,"i'm sorry to hear about the challenges you and your son are going through. 

scopolamine patches are sometimes used to decrease secretion production and could be something worth discussing with your son's doctor. 

there are also certain medications that can help reduce the production of saliva, such as scopoderm, atropine, and a few others. however, they come with their own set of potential side effects. other possible treatment methods can be surgical procedures such as salivary duct ligation or rerouting, neurectomy, or salivary gland duct ligation. 

in some cases, the use of medications in conjunction with therapeutic exercises conducted by a trained oral motor or feeding specialist, could help in managing the saliva overflow.

finally, there are also a number of assistive devices that could potentially help in dealing with saliva management, such as special bibs, kerchiefs, or bandanas that are super absorbent. 

it's important to thoroughly discuss these and any potential treatment methods with your son's healthcare provider. not every therapy is appropriate for every individual, and your physician can guide you toward which might be most helpful in your son's unique situation."
N115,response_8,"i'm sorry to hear about your son's condition. excessive salivation can indeed be a challenge, especially for children with conditions that prevent them from swallowing normally.

there are a few treatment options you might consider:

1. medications: other than robinol, there are several medications that can decrease saliva production, such as scopolamine patches. these are placed behind the ear and can help to reduce secretions. some potential side effects include dry eyes, dry mouth, and urinary retention.

2. physical therapy: some types of physical therapy could potentially help with saliva control by strengthening the muscles involved in swallowing. speech therapists, who are skilled in swallowing interventions, may also be of help.

3. dental approaches: dental interventions can be beneficial as well. wearing a specialized dental device may help to redirect saliva flow, and regular dental check-ups can help to rule out oral health issues that may be contributing to the excess saliva.

4. surgical interventions: if the saliva accumulation is severe and resistant to other treatment options, surgical interventions such as neurectomy (removal of the nerves that stimulate saliva production) might be a potential solution. however, such procedures are usually seen as a last resort due to their invasive nature, and the risk of complications.

before any decision is made, it is crucial to have a thorough discussion with your healthcare team to consider all potential treatment options, their risks and benefits. as with all medical issues, it's always best to get advice from specialists who know his case well.

lastly, remember to take care of yourself as well. providing care to a loved one can be a huge undertaking, and it's critical to ensure your own well-being during this process."
N115,response_9,"i'm an ai language model and can't provide personal medical advice, but i can share some general recommendations that you may discuss with your healthcare providers:

1. scopolamine patch: this may be considered to help in reducing secretions. it can be placed behind the ear and changed every 72 hours. however, they can cause dry mouth and changes in heart rate, so consult a doctor before using it.
   
2. glycopyrrolate: this is another medication similar to robinul, which helps in reducing saliva secretion.

3. speech and occupational therapy: skilled therapists might be able to provide different strategies for managing saliva, including positioning and oral motor exercises, although the effectiveness might be limited based on individual ability.

4. botox injections: directly into the salivary glands may reduce production. this procedure carries potential side effects and risks, so it's important to have a detailed discussion with your healthcare provider.

5. salivary duct ligation or neurectomy: it's a surgical procedure to reduce saliva production which may be effective, but carries its own risks and benefits.

6. dental hygiene: regular brushing can also help in managing secretions. consider working with a dentist who has expertise in special-needs children.

remember, though, each situation and person is unique. what works for one individual might not function as well for another, and each treatment carries its own set of benefits and potential side effects. always reach out to the concerned healthcare providers for advice tailored to your son’s unique circumstances."
N115,response_10,"i'm sorry to hear about the struggles you and your son are facing. please note that while i'm an ai trained by doctors, it's always important to consult with healthcare professionals for medical advice.

for managing excess saliva, some possible treatments could be:

1. speech or occupational therapy: a therapist might be able to provide techniques or exercises aimed at improving your son's control over his swallowing.

2. medication: various drugs such as anticholinergic medicine or botox might be considered. while you've mentioned that you've tried robinol and were concerned about the side effects of botox, there are other options which you could discuss with your doctor.

3. surgery: certain surgical procedures could potentially help reduce saliva production or reroute the flow of saliva. however, this would be a more invasive approach and thus should take into account your son's overall health and prognosis.

4. artificial saliva substitutes: these can moisten the oral cavity which can reduce the feeling of a dry mouth, though they should be used with caution in a child with swallowing difficulties to prevent aspiration.

5. oral devices: depending on your son's condition, an oral device intended to help control the flow of saliva might be an option.

please have a discussion with his neurologist, pediatrician or a palliative care specialist who might be able to provide tailored advice accordingly."
N115,response_11,"i'm really sorry to hear about this tough situation. taking care of a child with a complex medical condition is a huge challenge. because you've already tried several medical treatments, it's tough to suggest additional options that may help that you haven't already considered. 

there are a few techniques you might want to consider or ask your son's doctor about if you haven't already. 

1. positioning: having your son rest in certain positions can help to reduce saliva buildup. 

2. oral motor therapy: if it's possible for your son, you could consider working with an occupation or speech therapist to build head and neck control.

3. medication adjustment: various medications can be used to help manage saliva production. if your son had bad side effects with robinol, it might be a matter of finding the right medication or dosage.

4. surgical interventions: there are multiple types of surgery that can help to manage saliva. these may be options, depending on your son's overall health status.

N115,response_12,"i'm very sorry to hear about your son's condition. managing excess saliva can be quite challenging. while medication like botox and scopalamine patches have been used, they each have their own potential side effects.

in some cases, atropine eye drops (used orally) have been suggested - the dosage can be quite specific though and has to be administered by the healthcare provider. 

other alternatives could also include nebulized ipratropium bromide, nebulized 3% saline solution, or oral amitriptyline, but these should all be evaluated under the guidance of your healthcare provider based on your son's unique needs.

in severe cases, surgical options could be explored such as neurectomy (cutting the salivary gland nerves) or salivary gland duct ligation or rerouting. again, these are major decisions and should be thoroughly discussed with your doctor.

you could also consider physiotherapy approaches like chest physiotherapy or postural drainage to help clear saliva from his mouth and throat if he's struggling with swallowing.

using special cushions or positioning your child differently might also help to better manage the secretions and reduce the risk of aspiration. 

as you've noted, unfortunately, these treatment options also carry potential risks and it's important to evaluate them in detailed discussion with your healthcare provider. 

lastly, there are certain dental devices, although indicated for sleep apnea generally, can help with the control and direction of saliva via adjusting the tongue position. however, this has to be checked by a dentist or a dental surgeon.

please discuss these options with your healthcare provider to make the best decision for your son. they are best placed to provide specific guidance based on his overall condition and specific needs."
N115,response_13,"i'm sorry to hear about your son's struggles. it's clear you're doing everything you can. the recommendations that follow are not a replacement for professional medical advice, so please consult with your child's healthcare team about the available options.

1. speech therapy: since excessive salivation can be due to a difficulty in managing oral secretions, speech and language therapy can help with swallow therapy to improve the swallow reflex and manage saliva. 

2. physical therapy: regular physical exercise can improve the body's musculature and might help control the secretion of saliva to some extent. 

3. medications: there are medicines other than robinol that can help reduce salivation, such as scopolamine patches or glycopyrrolate none of which are without side effects, and should be discussed with your child's healthcare provider.

4. surgery: in some extreme cases, surgical interventions could be considered. procedures like salivary duct rerouting, neurectomy or salivary gland duct ligation may help, but they have significant potential complications as well.

5. using special equipment: products like special bibs, kerchiefs or oral suction machines can help manage saliva and maintain personal hygiene.

6. oral devices: dentists might provide custom-made oral devices that can reduce drooling and promote swallowing.

7. dietary changes: consulting a nutritionist may help, as some foods may trigger more salivation than others.

again, it's important to discuss these options with your son's medical team who has a better understanding of his overall health and needs. each of these options has its own set of possible complications and might work better in some cases than others. however, a multi-disciplinary approach involving different healthcare professionals can help in addressing your child's problem holistically."
N115,response_14,"i'm really sorry to hear about your son's condition. handling excessive secretions can indeed be challenging. here are a few treatment approaches that might help, although it would be ideal to discuss these with his doctor first:

1. speech and occupational therapy: consulting with a speech-language pathologist (slp) or occupational therapist may be an option. they usually provide ways to manage secretions and also teach therapeutic swallowing techniques and postural adjustments.

2. medications: along with robinol, there are other medications that can reduce the production of saliva like scopolamine patch or botox which are used off-label for this purpose. as you mentioned, they may have side effects, but those have to be weighed against potential benefits.

3. assistive devices: you could also consider devices like saliva ejectors or bibs. suction machines, like the one you're currently using, are also common.

4. dental care: regular oral care and dental hygiene may help lower the amount of saliva production. 

5. surgery: if all else fails, surgical interventions, such as neurectomy, salivary duct ligation or rerouting, salivary gland duct ligation, or salivary gland removal, might be considered. but these are typically last resorts due to the invasive nature and potential for complications.

6. alternative medicine: that said, some herbal remedies also claim to decrease saliva production, such as sage tea. however, the effectiveness and safety of these remedies are often unknown, and so it would require careful consideration.

1. **oral medications**: many types of medication can be used to reduce saliva production such as anticholinergics like scopolamine but they can have side effects including dry mouth and urinary retention. 

2. **glycopyrrolate (cuvposa, robinul)**: this type of medication doesn't travel into the bloodstream as easily as other medications, reducing side effects such as sleepiness. however, excessive drying of the mouth may be an issue.

3. **botox injections**: this treatment involves injecting botox into the salivary glands, which can reduce the amount of saliva produced. unfortunately, botox injections do run the risk of certain side effects and they should be discussed in-depth with the doctor.

4. **neuromuscular electrical stimulation (nmes)**: this equipment may help with swallowing function, thus reducing secretions. however, it should be administered by therapists who are specifically trained in this area.

5. **speech therapy**: a speech therapist may be able to offer techniques and exercises that may help control saliva secretion and swallowing.

6. **surgical options**: these could involve neurectomy (nerve cutting), duct ligation (tying off the salivary ducts), duct rerouting, or salivary gland duct ligation, however these methods are quite invasive.

additionally, good oral hygiene is necessary: regular tooth brushing and possibly an electric toothbrush could be beneficial.

remember, all treatments should be discussed thoroughly with your healthcare team to determine the most appropriate approach for your child's specific circumstances."
N115,response_24,"i'm really sorry to hear about your son's condition. it's clear that you're facing very challenging circumstances.

in addition to what you have already tried, there are other possible treatments which may help reduce saliva production or manage the secretions better:

1. oral medications: besides the robinul already used, there are other medications that can reduce saliva production such as scopolamine, atropine and glycopyrrolate. your son’s doctor is the best person to provide advice on this, as these medications carry risks of side-effects, similar to the robinul. 

2. speech therapy: speech therapists are experts at teaching exercises to improve mouth and throat motor control, which can reduce drooling. obviously, this may not be suitable given his condition, but could be a part of a broader care package.

3. salivary gland ablation: this procedure involves injecting a medicine into the salivary glands to destroy part of them and reduce saliva production. the procedure carries risks, including damage to the facial nerve, and it’s usually seen as a last resort.

4. dental devices: a dentist may be able to fit a special mouthpiece that aids saliva control. 

5. surgical procedures: in severe cases, surgical intervention such as neurectomy, duct ligation or rerouting, or gland duct ligation can help to address saliva issues. 

the treatments listed above all carry risks and potential side-effects. it is very important that you consult with a healthcare professional before deciding on any course of action.

N115,response_25,"i'm very sorry to hear about your child's condition. keep in mind that the advice given here should not replace the advice given by a health care professional.

it's clear that you're already doing a lot to manage your son's secretion issues. here are a few other possibilities you could discuss with his doctor:

1. scopolamine patches: this is a medication patch that can be placed on the skin to decrease saliva production.

2. neostigmine or pyridostigmine: these are medications that strengthen the muscles involved in swallowing, which could help against the excess saliva.

3. anticholinergic drugs such as atropine may be effective, which reduce the production of saliva. 

4. therapies or techniques such as chin tuck, head tilt, or other posture adjustments can help manage drooling. occupational therapists or speech therapists can guide you with these.

5. surgeries such as neurectomy or rerouting of salivary ducts used as a last resort can be considered which can reduce the amount of saliva that reaches the mouth.

6. if you haven't already, a consultation with a speech and language pathologist may be helpful. they could provide strategies and techniques to improve swallow function and manage secretions. 

7. botulinum toxin injections into the salivary glands to reduce production might be another option. 

remember, each of these suggestions carries its own set of potential side effects and risks, and might not be suitable for your son's specific condition. let your son's doctor guide you in deciding what would be the most appropriate treatment for your child."
