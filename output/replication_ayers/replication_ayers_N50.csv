N50,response_1,"the cdc in the united states recently expanded the recommendation for the hpv vaccine up to age 45 for both men and women. this is good news for individuals who did not previously have the vaccine and are sexually active. 

as far as your hashimoto's is concerned, there is currently no evidence suggesting that the hpv vaccine would interfere with your condition or its management. 

while it's important to have this conversation with your healthcare provider for personalized advice, generally speaking, it's not too late for you to receive the vaccine based on your age alone. the best way to protect against hpv is by getting vaccinated, so it's worth considering. 

in new zealand, you may need to pay for the vaccine if you are over the age of 26 as it's usually free for individuals aged 9-26. you can check with your local healthcare provider for more information."
N50,response_2,"the hpv vaccine is definitely worth considering, especially if you haven't been infected with any of the hpv strains the vaccine protects against. the advisory committee on immunization practices (acip) recommends routine hpv vaccination for boys and girls at the age of 11 or 12, but vaccination can be started at age 9. 
the hpv vaccine – gardasil 9 – is also recommended for everyone through age 26 years, if they were not adequately vaccinated already. however, even people up to the age of 45 can receive the hpv vaccine based on discussion with their healthcare provider. regarding your autoimmune condition, it generally does not contraindicate receipt of vaccines.
however, specific recommendations regarding vaccination including eligibility, schedule and availability may vary between different countries. hence, it would be best to have a discussion with your doctor to clear any doubts and make an informed decision."
N50,response_3,"yes, you can still receive the hpv vaccine. the hpv vaccine is recommended for people up to age 26. however, even people up to the age of 45 can still receive it under certain conditions.  speak to your doctor to discuss this further. the hpv vaccine has been found to be both safe and effective in preventing some types of human papilloma virus, some of which are known to cause certain types of cancers such as cervical cancer. 

your autoimmune condition (hashimoto's) is generally not a contraindication for receiving the hpv vaccine, but you should discuss this with your healthcare provider who will consider your complete medical history. the benefit of the hpv vaccine is that it can help prevent new hpv infections. 

please remember, even if you get the hpv vaccine, it is important to continue regular cervical screening (pap tests) since the vaccine doesn't protect against all types of hpv that can cause cancer. 

however, you must talk this through with a healthcare professional who knows your health history and can provide personalized advice."
N50,response_4,"yes, it is both possible and recommended for you to get the hpv vaccine. the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) currently recommends hpv vaccination for everyone through age 26. for adults 27 through 45, the hpv vaccine can be given if you have not received it previously or if you did not complete the series of shots. it can help prevent new infections with the types of hpv the vaccine covers, so it may still be beneficial even if you've previously had a hpv infection. 

having an autoimmune condition like hashimoto’s disease doesn't make the vaccine less effective or increase the risk of side effects. however, you should always check with your healthcare provider before getting any vaccine to make sure you don't have any specific contraindications."
N50,response_5,"yes, it is still possible and worth it for you to get the hpv vaccine. 

according to the new zealand immunization schedule, the hpv vaccine is recommended and free for both males and females up to and including 26 years of age. even though you're at the upper limit of the age range, you are still eligible for the vaccine.

the hpv vaccine is designed to prevent infection from certain types of human papillomavirus that are known to cause cervical cancer, as well as some other types of cancer and genital warts. the vaccine is most effective when administered before individuals become sexually active, but it can still provide benefits to adults who are already sexually active.

having an autoimmune condition like hashimoto's doesn't necessarily mean that you can't or shouldn't get the hpv vaccine. many people with autoimmune conditions are able to receive vaccines without any complications. however, as with any vaccine, you should discuss it with your doctor to understand the potential benefits and risks in your specific situation."
N50,response_6,"yes, it is still worth getting the hpv vaccine. while it is often administered to adolescents before they become sexually active, it can also protect adults against new strains of the virus they have not yet been exposed to.

the hpv vaccine protects against certain types of human papillomavirus that can cause cancer, including cervical cancer, and genital warts. it is most effective when given before any sexual activity starts, as it cannot cure an existing hpv infection. however, even sexually active people can benefit as it can still protect against types of hpv they have not yet encountered.

according to the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc), the hpv vaccine is recommended for everyone through age 26, if they did not get vaccinated when they were younger. there may be some situations where vaccination up to age 45 may be beneficial. this decision should be made in consultation with your healthcare provider.

as for your autoimmune condition, typically hpv vaccination is not contraindicated in people with autoimmune diseases, and these vaccines have a good safety record. however, as with any health related decision, it is best to discuss this with your healthcare provider who can give you a recommendation based on your individual health circumstances.

please note that while condom use can reduce the risk of hpv, it does not eliminate the risk completely as hpv can infect areas not covered by a condom. therefore, vaccination is considered an important strategy in preventing hpv infection."
N50,response_7,"the hpv vaccine can be administered up to the age of 45 according to the guidelines from the us centers for disease control and prevention and the new zealand immunisation advisory centre. so it is not too late to get vaccinated at your age. it's designed to protect against the types of hpv that most commonly cause health problems such as cervical cancer and genital warts. the vaccine is most effective when given before sexual activity begins, but it can still be beneficial in decreasing the risk of hpv and the health problems it can cause even after sexual activity has begun. 

there's no evidence to suggest that the hpv vaccine would affect your autoimmune condition. however, you should discuss it with your doctor or healthcare provider who knows your medical history and can provide individualized advice.

protection from the hpv vaccine is expected to be long-lasting. but vaccination is not a substitute for routine cervical screening. in new zealand, regular cervical screening tests (also known as smear tests) are recommended for women aged 20 to 70 who have been sexually active. the hpv vaccine does not protect against all types of hpv that can cause cervical cancer, so regular screening is still vital."
N50,response_8,"yes, even if you are 26 years old, you can still get vaccinated for hpv if you haven't been fully vaccinated. according to the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention (cdc), an hpv vaccine is generally recommended for everyone through age 26 in the united states. however, some adults between the ages of 27 and 45 years may decide to get the hpv vaccine after speaking with their doctor about their risk for new hpv infections and the potential benefits of vaccination.

hpv vaccination in this age range provides less benefit, as more people have already been exposed to hpv. but there will still be some benefit in getting the vaccination if you have not yet been exposed to the types of hpv covered by the vaccine.

having an autoimmune disease does not necessarily preclude you from receiving the vaccine but you should discuss it thoroughly with your healthcare provider. they will be able to assess your personal risk and the benefits of the vaccine for you.

since you are in new zealand, please make sure to discuss this with a local healthcare provider as the recommendations might be slightly different from the cdc guidance."
N50,response_9,"the hpv vaccine is generally recommended for people up to age 26. however, the united states centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) has recommended that the vaccine can be given up to age 45 based on shared clinical decision-making.

the primary aim of the hpv vaccine is to prevent new hpv infections -- it cannot treat existing infections nor hpv-associated diseases. it is most effective when given before any exposure to hpv.

having an autoimmune condition, in your case hashimoto's thyroiditis, does not contraindicate receiving the hpv vaccine. indeed, vaccines are generally recommended for people with autoimmune conditions as they are at a greater risk of infections.

given your situation, especially as you have not previously received the hpv vaccine, i would recommend discussing this with your healthcare provider. they can provide a recommendation most suited to your specific circumstances.

please remember, even if vaccinated against hpv, ongoing cervical screening is important as the vaccine does not protect against all types of hpv that can cause cervical cancer."
N50,response_10,"the hpv vaccine is generally recommended for people aged 9 to 26 years old, but it can be still be beneficial for women up to the age of 45 years. some guidelines do recommend it for people up to this age, especially if they haven't been previously vaccinated and are at risk of new hpv infections. it is definitely worth discussing this with your doctor. 

furthermore, your autoimmune condition, hashimoto's, should not affect your ability to receive the hpv vaccine. the vaccine has not been found to increase the risk of autoimmune diseases. 

keep in mind that while the vaccine is best at preventing hpv infections before any exposure to hpv (meaning before sexual activity begins), it can still offer protection if given later.  hpv vaccine can protect against some types of hpv that can lead to cancer or genital warts.

remember it's always preferable to have a personal discussion with your doctor to understand your personal risk benefit scenario."
N50,response_11,"the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) recommends the hpv vaccine for everyone through age 26, if they didn't get vaccinated when they were younger. for adults aged 27 through 45 years, the hpv vaccine is available for those who didn't get fully vaccinated when they were younger, but is not generally recommended since most adults in this age range have already been exposed to hpv. however, some adults (between 27-45 years) who are not adequately protected may decide to get the hpv vaccine after speaking with their healthcare provider about their risk for new hpv infections and the possible benefits of vaccination. 

having hashimoto's disease doesn't contraindicate hpv vaccination. in fact, getting vaccinated can help protect you against certain types of hpv that can cause cancers and diseases. 

you may want to reach out to your healthcare provider for advice tailored to your health history and risk factors. keep in mind that whilst the hpv vaccine can protect against the most common types of hpv that cause cancers and diseases, it doesn't protect against all types, so regular screenings are still important.

N50,response_12,"yes, you can still get the hpv vaccine. while it is commonly given to children and adolescents, it can also be given to adults up to the age of 45.

hpv (human papillomavirus) is the most common sexually transmitted infection. there are many different types of hpv, and some can cause health problems like genital warts and cancers. that's why getting vaccinated is an important preventative measure.

having hashimoto's disease doesn't affect the effectiveness of the vaccine. 

of course, your personal health situation should always be discussed with a health professional. your doctor can best guide you in this decision and discuss any potential risks or drawbacks."
N50,response_13,"in most countries, hpv vaccination is routinely offered to girls and boys aged 9-26 years old. although the vaccine is most effective when given to individuals before they become sexually active, the vaccine can still offer protection to individuals in their late twenties and older. in 2018, the u.s. food and drug administration approved the use of the hpv vaccine in males and females up to 45 years of age. you should consult with your healthcare provider to understand the potential benefits and risks, considering your specific situation. hashimoto's does not generally contraindicate hpv vaccination but still discuss this with your doctor."
N50,response_14,"yes, it is absolutely possible and likely beneficial for you to get the hpv vaccine at your age. in fact, the centers for disease control in the u.s. recently expanded the recommended age for the vaccine to include adults up to 45 years of age. the hpv vaccine helps protect against certain types of hpv that can lead to cancer or cause genital warts. even if you have been sexually active, getting vaccinated can still protect against strains of the virus you have not yet been exposed to.

having hashimoto's doesn't contraindicate the hpv vaccination. the important thing is to discuss this with your doctor, who will be familiar with your medical history and can give advice tailored specifically to your situation.

note: new zealand's national immunisation schedule provides free hpv vaccine for people aged 9 to 26. for those aged 27 to 45, the vaccine is not free, but still available. prior to taking any vaccine, it is recommended that you consult your healthcare provider to validate appropriateness, eligibility criteria and costs (if any)."
N50,response_15,"yes, it is still possible and worth it for you to receive the hpv vaccine. the gardasil 9 hpv vaccine is approved for use in individuals up to the age of 45. however, in some countries, publicly funded vaccination programs may only cover individuals up to a certain age. it would be best to speak to a healthcare provider to get more information on what options are available to you.

in terms of your autoimmune condition, having hashimoto's should not prevent you from getting the hpv vaccine. the vaccine should not interfere with your thyroid disorder or the effectiveness of your levothyroxine. but again, it is best to discuss this with your doctor who is more familiar with your medical history and personal context. the hpv vaccine is important for reducing the risk of cervical and other cancers."
N50,response_16,"yes, it is still possible to get the hpv vaccine at your age, and it is generally considered beneficial. in the united states, the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) recommend the vaccine for everyone up to the age of 26. new guidelines from 2020 have extended the age to 45 in some circumstances, but since you are 26, you are still within the primary recommended age range.

hpv (human papillomavirus) is a common sexually transmitted infection. some types of hpv can cause health problems such as genital warts and cancers of the cervix, vagina, vulva, penis, anus, and throat. the vaccine is designed to prevent most of these types of hpv.

hashimoto's should not affect your ability to get the vaccine, but you should always discuss any health conditions or concerns with your health care provider before getting any vaccine.

finally, even if you have always had protective sex, the hpv vaccine can still be beneficial. condoms do not protect against all types of hpv, and the vaccine can protect against types that you have not been exposed to.

keep in mind to discuss with your health care provider about the benefits and risks of the vaccine, taking into account your age, sexual history, and overall health.

as you are in new zealand, healthcare practices may slightly vary from those in the united states, so again, i would advise talking to your gp or women's health provider about this."
N50,response_17,"yes, it is definitely possible and recommended to get the hpv vaccine. although hpv vaccination is usually started in adolescents, it is recommended for everyone through the age of 26 years, regardless of their sexual activity. in some countries, hpv vaccination is even recommended up to the age of 45. 

moreover, the hpv vaccine is generally considered safe in people with autoimmune conditions. however, you should discuss this with your healthcare provider in order to decide the best course of action based on your individual case.

considering that hpv is a common sexually transmitted infection and that it can lead to several types of cancer, getting vaccinated is a great proactive step to protect your health."
N50,response_18,"in the us, the hpv vaccine is recommended for all individuals through age 26, and there is emerging guidance to potentially expand this through age 45. although the most important population to vaccinate is females between 11-26 years old (and males, for that matter), there is evidence to support that the vaccine may be beneficial in older populations as well. 

having an autoimmune condition does not contraindicate the hpv vaccine. 

however, authority to provide the vaccine and specific recommendations would vary by country. i would recommend speaking with your local healthcare provider or public health department in new zealand to understand what the specific guidelines are in your country. they will be able to advise you on the benefits and potential risks, as well as where you can access the vaccine if it is recommended for you. 

remember, regardless of whether you get vaccinated for hpv or not, it is still important to go for your regular cervical cancer screenings (pap and hpv tests) as recommended by your healthcare provider."
N50,response_19,"yes, you can still get the hpv vaccine at your age. the hpv vaccine can help protect against the types of hpv that most commonly cause cancer, including cervical cancer. it is typically given at a younger age because it works best if given before a person starts having sex, but it can still provide protection if you receive it later.

in the united states, the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) currently recommends the hpv vaccine for everyone through age 26, and for some adults age 27-45 who have not been previously vaccinated, based on shared clinical decision making. 

regarding autoimmune conditions, there currently is not any specific contraindication for vaccination in people with autoimmune conditions like hashimoto's. however, you should discuss this with your healthcare provider to make the best decision for your personal health. 

considering you are located in new zealand, the guidelines might be slightly different. therefore, i would suggest you to discuss this matter with your doctor to have detailed information."
N50,response_20,"in the united states, the hpv vaccine is generally recommended for individuals up to the age of 26, so you are still within the recommended age range.

with regards to your autoimmune condition, the hpv vaccine is typically considered safe for individuals with autoimmune conditions, but this is something you should definitely discuss with your doctor before getting the vaccine.

finally as to whether it's worth it, the hpv vaccine can protect against certain types of hpv that can lead to cancer. even though you always had protected sex, condoms don't fully protect against hpv, because the virus can infect areas that aren't covered by a condom. so getting vaccinated could potentially reduce your future risk of developing cervical cancer.

however, the final decision should always be made with your health care provider, with whom you should have a conversation about your personal risks and benefits regarding the hpv vaccine.

since you're living in new zealand, the guidelines might be somewhat different. it's best to also discuss this with your health care provider there."
N50,response_21,"yes, it is still possible to get the hpv vaccine at age 26. the vaccine is recommended for all people until the age of 26, although it can be given until the age of 45 for those who didn't get vaccinated when they were younger. 

your history of protective sex does not guarantee that you aren't carrying any of the hpv strains targeted by the vaccine. condoms can not protect against all types of hpv, as it can be spread through skin-to-skin contact with any infected area of the body and not just through sexual intercourse.

having an autoimmune condition, specifically hashimoto's, does not contra-indicate receiving the hpv vaccine. in fact, vaccination would be very important in your case to prevent cervical dysplasia and cancer (which can be caused by the high-risk types of hpv the vaccine protects against).

however, this is a decision you should make after discussing with your primary care provider or gynecologist who would have better knowledge of your general health and could provide more personalised advice. be sure to review available research and recommendations together to ensure the best decision for your individual case."
N50,response_22,"yes, it is still worth getting vaccinated against hpv. the vaccine, called gardasil 9, is approved for use in both men and women up to age 45 in some countries. it protects against several types of hpv, including those most commonly linked to cervical, vaginal, vulvar, anal, and throat cancers, as well as genital warts. 

there is no evidence to suggest that the vaccine would have any adverse effects on someone with an autoimmune condition like hashimoto's. it also doesn't interact with levothyroxine or any other common medications. 

however, you should discuss this with your doctor or an immunization provider, who can provide you with more specific advice based on your medical history and the immunization guidelines in new zealand."
N50,response_23,"the hpv vaccine is typically given to boys and girls between the ages of 9 and 14, but it's also recommended for everyone through age 26 if they were not adequately vaccinated already. so, you are still within the age limit recommended by the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) for hpv vaccination.

there are no specific data on the use of hpv vaccine in individuals with autoimmune diseases. however, as a rule, inactivated vaccines like the hpv vaccine are not contraindicated in patients with autoimmune diseases. it's always a good idea to discuss this with your doctor or a specialist who is familiar with your medical history. 

the hpv vaccine is effective in preventing viral strains responsible for most cervical cancers and many genital warts. even if someone has been sexually active and possibly exposed to hpv, they could still benefit from the vaccine as it is unlikely they have been exposed to all the hpv types included in the vaccine. please consult with your healthcare provider since they can offer the best advice based on your health history."
N50,response_24,"yes, it is absolutely possible and worth it to receive the hpv vaccine even at the age of 26 and with hashimoto's thyroiditis. hpv vaccination can protect against multiple types of hpv that can cause cancers later in life. it's especially important to get vaccinated if you have not already been infected with hpv.

in the us, the hpv vaccine is now approved for women and men through age 45, so 26 is definitely not too late. however, the specific age limit can differ based on your location such as new zealand. you should contact your healthcare provider for guidance tailored to your circumstances. 

regarding your autoimmune condition, hashimoto's thyroiditis is an autoimmune condition affecting the thyroid, but it doesn't generally cause the kind of immune compromise that would make vaccines risky or less effective. however, if you are taking any immune-suppressing medications or have concerns, it's always a good idea to discuss this with your doctor."
N50,response_25,"yes, it's not too late for you to get the hpv vaccine. in fact, it is recommended for individuals up to age 26. in some cases, it may even be given up to age 45 depending on individual risk, although this would usually require a discussion and recommendation from a healthcare provider. 

as for your condition, hashimoto's disease and use of levothyroxine should not be a contraindication to getting the hpv vaccine. most autoimmune conditions do not preclude vaccination. it's always best to discuss this with your doctor before deciding, but there should not necessarily be a problem.

the hpv vaccine can help protect against several types of hpv that can cause cancer. since hpv can be spread through sexual contact, it is a good idea to get vaccinated if you have not been already, regardless of your sexual history.

remember that even if you've had protective sex, condoms do not fully prevent the risk of hpv transmission. this is why getting vaccinated could still be beneficial.

however, ultimately this is something you should discuss with your healthcare provider to discuss the pros and cons."
