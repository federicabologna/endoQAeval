N191,response_1,"it's reassuring that the lump has been stable and not changing over the past week, but it still deserves evaluation to confirm what it is. penile cancer is pretty rare, especially in someone your age, but it's not impossible. 

other possibilities include a cyst, fibrous plaque (a condition called peyronie's disease), or a thrombosed (blocked) vein which is something called mondor's disease. penile cysts and plaques don't usually require any treatment unless they are causing you discomfort or if it's affecting sexual function.

the sooner you can have it looked at the better, for your peace of mind if nothing else. if you cannot get an immediate appointment with your regular doctor, a walk-in center would be an effective alternative. it doesn't sound like an emergency situation where you would need to go to the er. be sure to mention your past issues with inflamed epididymitis as it may be related. 

please also note, while you stated that you've maintained the same sexual partner and have been screened for stis, it may be a good idea to be re-screened if it has been a while or if your symptoms persist/escalate."
N191,response_2,"it's good that you've noticed this change in your body and are planning to seek medical attention - as it's important to err on the side of caution when it comes to changes like these. however, it doesn't sound like an emergency situation, so it may not be necessary to go to the er. while penile cancer should always be a consideration, it is rare and there are several other, more common possibilities that could explain your symptoms such as peyronieâ€™s disease, small cysts, or fibrosis. 

you should certainly make an appointment with your doctor. in the meantime, try not to worry too much - it's much more likely to be something that is easily resolved. however, it's always best to get checked out and follow the recommended medical advice. if you do see any signs of infection (increased redness, pain, or pus), or if the lump starts to rapidly grow in size, it would be advisable to seek immediate medical attention."
N191,response_3,"firstly, it is important that you get this checked out by a medical professional; however, from your description it does not sound like an emergency. it is more suitable to either make an appointment or visit a walk-in centre if that would result in a quicker examination. 

the lump you described could be due to various reasons. it could be related to penile trauma or injury, an infection, a cyst, or a peyronie's plaque (a hard lump on the penis that is a sign of peyronie's disease, a disorder in which scar tissue, called a plaque, forms in the penis). in rare instances, it could be due to penile cancer, although this is quite unlikely given your age and lack of risk factors. other symptoms associated with penile cancer would include changes in the colour of your penis, a foul-smelling discharge, or possibly sores that do not heal.

in terms of glands, there are no glands under the skin of the penis itself. however, the prostate and seminal vesicles are nearby, deeper in the pelvis. 

i would also note that dehydration can cause stinging while urinating due to concentrated urine; make sure to drink plenty of fluids.

remember, any changes or concerns related to the penis should be discussed and evaluated by a health professional, particularly if they persist or are causing you distress."
N191,response_4,"it's difficult to determine the cause of the lump without a proper physical examination. it could be a number of things, but some possible causes include a cyst, a fibrous tissue growth (peyronie's disease), or penile cancer as you mentioned, although this is quite rare. it is important to get it checked by a healthcare provider to rule out any serious issues. if you don't have any other symptoms such as fever, severe pain, difficulty urinating or signs of infection, you may be able to wait until monday to see your primary care doctor. otherwise, a trip to the urgent care or walk-in center may be necessary. in the intervening time, it would be wise to avoid anything that might irritate the area further, like sexual activity."
N191,response_5,"the lump you're feeling could be several things, from an inflamed hair follicle, a cyst, to a fibrous tissue (peyronie's disease), or less likely, cancer. if the lump is causing you discomfort, pain, or causing any difficulty in urination, you may want to seek immediate medical attention. if not, you can likely wait to see a primary healthcare provider or urologist during normal office hours.

penile cancer is quite rare and typically occurs on the skin of the penis, not underneath it as a palpable lump. it's more often related to hpv infection, smoking, or having a history of phimosis. it's more common in older men, usually in their 60s, so it's also less likely because of your age.

never the less, i would suggest seeing a doctor for a proper evaluation and diagnosis. try not to fret too much before you have more information - many penis lumps turn out to be non-cancerous."
N191,response_6,"the lump you're describing could be a number of things, ranging from relatively harmless (a simple cyst or a blocked gland, for example) to more serious conditions. while penile cancer is not common, especially in younger men, it's important to have any new growths checked by a healthcare provider. given that it doesn't seem to be causing you any immediate distress or severe pain, it's probably fine to wait until normal clinic hours to see a doctor, but if you're feeling anxious about it, going to a walk-in clinic could help put your mind at ease. keep in mind that you are your best advocate when it comes to your health. if something doesn't feel right, it's always better to get checked out."
N191,response_7,"i'm an ai and while i can't wirelessly examine you, based on your description this could be several things, including a harmless cyst, an infection, or a form of peyronie's disease (scar tissue causing a lump). other causes like an sti seem unlikely based on your screening 6 months ago.
penile cancer is very rare, especially in younger men, and while possible it would tend to be a last possibility after ruling out more common conditions.
if the lump is not causing you pain, it's not bleeding, and you don't have any other concerning symptoms such as fever, difficulty urinating, painful erections, penile curve, etc., it probably isn't an emergency that would require an er visit.
however, this is something that should be evaluated by a healthcare professional in-person to establish a proper diagnosis and treatment plan. it would be advisable to schedule an appointment with a healthcare provider or visit a walk-in clinic at your earliest convenience. avoid manipulating the lump excessively to prevent any potential harm.
remember, online advice is not a substitute for real medical advice. please consult with a healthcare professional for a proper examination."
N191,response_8,"i understand this might be causing you stress, but don't worry prematurely. there could be a number of potential causes for this lump, including peyronie's disease (scar tissue in the penis), an infection, a cyst, and others. penile cancer is very rare and usually presents other symptoms as well. however, it's very important to get it checked. 

you should make an appointment with your doctor next week for an evaluation. if the lump starts to cause you substantial pain or discomfort, or if you experience other troubling symptoms (like bleeding, unusual discharge, or fevers), then it would be appropriate to visit an urgent care or emergency department.

in the meantime, try to stay hydrated and avoid any sexual activity that causes discomfort. it's also worth noting that the use of nicotine in any form is a risk factor for various health conditions, including cardiovascular disease, and i would advise considering stopping."
N191,response_9,"while this likely isn't penile cancer given your age and sexual health history, you definitely should seek medical attention. even if it's not serious, it's best to get reassurance from a professional. because it isn't causing immediate harm or severe pain, you probably don't need to go to the er. you could wait to make an appointment with your usual doctor, or if you're very worried, visit a walk-in centre. as for what it could be, one possibility is peyronie's disease, which is a build up of scar tissue in the penis causing hard lumps. it's also possible that it could be a cyst or a fibrous plaque. however, i must stress you should consult a medical doctor."
N191,response_10,"there are many possible causes for the lump you found, not all of them serious. it could be a hardened lymph vessel, a cyst, a fibrous plaque from peyronie's disease, or even a thrombosed (clotted) vein. more concerning possibilities include penile cancer, but this is quite rare and usually presents with other symptoms like changes in color or thickness of the skin, sores, or discharge.

in any case, it's important to get a proper medical evaluation. given your description, it does not seem like an emergency that requires a visit to the er. however, you should definitely make an appointment with your doctor or visit a walk-in clinic as soon as possible, because an examination and possibly some tests are necessary to determine what this lump is. hope everything goes well, and remember that it's always better to be safe and get things checked out when they arise, especially when it comes to your health."
N191,response_11,"it's understandable to worry about unusual lumps and bumps. the lump you're describing might be a variety of things, such as a cyst, fibrosis due to trauma or inflammation, a calcified mass, or possibly less likely, a tumor. the way you describe it, though, it does not sound typical of penile cancer. but diagnosing it properly would require a physical examination by a doctor. 

given there's no sign of severe pain, trauma, bleeding, or urinary obstruction, it's unlikely this situation needs emergency evaluation. however, you should seek medical evaluation soon since you're noticing occasional stinging during urination.

you can wait to make an appointment with your primary care provider, or if convenient, go to a walk-in clinic. they can consider getting an ultrasound or referring you to a specialist in urology if necessary.

in the meantime, keep yourself hydrated and abstain from sexual activities that could exacerbate any potential trauma or inflammation. the chances are high that it's something benign, but any abnormal growth should be evaluated by a healthcare provider to rule out serious health issues."
N191,response_12,"penile lumps can be caused by several conditions, most of which are not serious. potential causes could include a cyst, a thrombosed (blocked) vein, or peyronie's disease (which causes hard lumps of plaque to form). penile cancer is a real, but extremely rare condition, and usually presents with unexplained changes in the skin, such as rashes, growths, or color changes. 

given your description, a visit to the emergency room might not be necessary, unless the lump is causing you severe pain or discomfort. you should schedule an appointment with your doctor as soon as possible to have the lump evaluated. in the meantime, you may wish to monitor the lump. also, taking a note of any changes in size, color, or pain as well any changes in urination or sexual function may be helpful for your doctor. if you notice it gets drastically worse over the weekend then you should consider going to the er."
N191,response_13,"it's not likely to be an emergency that needs immediate attention, such as going to the er. however, it's important you get this checked out at soon as you can, as you have rightly identified. given it's the weekend, a walk-in center might be your best option if you're feeling very anxious about this and don't want to wait until monday to schedule an appointment.

the lump you have described could potentially be several things - it could be a cyst, a blocked penile gland, a thrombosed (clotted) penile vein, or peyronie's disease (scar tissue causing hard lumps). while less common, penile cancer should also be considered.

it's very important to have a physical examination and potentially an ultrasound scan. your gp or the walk-in center can organize this. for now, try not to worry too much, but certainly get it checked out in the near future."
N191,response_14,"given your symptoms, it's possible that it could be something like a blocked oil gland or a sebaceous cyst, especially if the lump is hard and non-tender. penile cancer would usually present with a change in colour or thickness of the skin, a lump, or an ulcer/breakdown of the skin. importantly, it remains a relatively rare condition.

occasional stinging when you urinate could be due to dehydration, as you mentioned, but urinary symptoms might also be suggestive of a urinary tract infection, especially if you also notice any unusual penile discharge.

i wouldn't classify your situation as an emergency, but i do think it warrants a visit to your primary care physician or a walk-in clinic in the next few days to be evaluated. keep an eye on it over the weekend. if you notice an abrupt change, such as severe pain, increased size, redness, or fever, then you may want to seek out emergency care.

this is not intended as a replacement for a proper evaluation from a healthcare provider. please seek medical attention to get a definitive diagnosis."
N191,response_15,"given that it's still the weekend, i would suggest you visit a walk-in center or an urgent care clinic as soon as possible for evaluation. if they deem it necessary, they may refer you to the appropriate specialist. this might be a urologist, who specializes in disorders of the urinary tract, or a dermatologist, if they suspect it is a skin condition. conditions that could potentially cause the symptoms you're experiencing include peyronie's disease (scar tissue causing hard lumps), a sebaceous cyst (a benign lump filled with sebum, a gunky substance), or possibly even a blocked sweat gland or hair follicle. penile cancer is quite rare and typically presents with other symptoms like redness, discomfort, bleeding, or changes in the skin. remember, only a healthcare professional can give a definitive diagnosis. and, in the future, it's important to get any new or unexplained lumps or bumps checked out promptly."
N191,response_16,"it's understandable that you're concerned about this lump. penile cancer, though possible, is quite rare, especially in men your age. your symptoms could be due to a variety of other conditions such as peyronie's disease (which leads to fibrous scar tissue inside the penis), a cyst, a lymphocele, or even hardened veins. regardless, it's important to get it checked out. if you're not experiencing severe pain or other alarming symptoms such as difficulty urinating or blood in urine, you likely don't need to go to the er and can wait to see a doctor during regular hours. however, if you're feeling very anxious about it and going to a walk-in center will give you peace of mind, it may be worth it. keep in mind that you'll likely need a referral to a urologist for a definitive diagnosis."
N191,response_17,"i'm a language model ai developed by open ai and i'm not a doctor, though i can help provide some guidance. do not panic about penile cancer. it is extremely rare especially in men below 60. however, any unexplained lump should be checked out by a physician. this could also be a benign cyst or fibrosis that forms due to various reasons, among other causes. the burning sensation you sometimes feel when you urinate may be due to dehydration, a urinary tract infection, kidney stones or potentially an std, even though you have been screened recently. you should make an appointment with your doctor as soon as possible to have it examined, as going to the er may not be necessary unless you begin experiencing severe pain, high fever, or other concerning symptoms. a urologist may be the best specialist to consult on this issue. please consult with a healthcare professional."
N191,response_18,"i'm an ai language model and not a doctor but from your description, the lump you're experiencing could be due to several reasons: a cyst, a blocked gland, a fibrous tissue formation, or, less commonly, a penile cancer. the stinging sensation during urination could be related to hydration, as you mentioned. however, it's also worth considering urinary tract infection if the sensation persists.

penile cancer is more common in older men (over the age of 60), and it typically appears as a growth or sore on the penile skin. it could also be linked to human papillomavirus (hpv) infection. keep in mind these are also general symptoms of many other conditions, some of which are benign.

generally, this doesn't sound like an emergency (not severe pain, no bleeding, no difficulty urinating) and you could wait for normal office hours to visit your doctor. however, i would highly recommend getting it checked out by a healthcare professional. your doctor may perform physical exam, and ask for ultrasound or biopsy to determine the exact nature of the lump.

remember to provide full disclosure of your medical history and any other abnormal symptom you may have noticed. please do not attempt to diagnose yourself and follow the healthcare professional's advice."
N191,response_19,"it would be hard to definitely diagnose you here, considering the symptoms you've mentioned, but it could potentially be a sclerosing lymphangitis or peironie's disease. both are benign conditions, relatively common and often caused by sexual activity. they can be a result of trauma - even an injury that you didn't notice at the time. however, it's very important that you see a gp as soon as possible to rule out penile cancer or another serious disease. an er visit may not be necessary as your situation isn't life-threatening, but waiting until monday might not be the best choice either considering your anxiety. a walk-in clinic would be a good alternative."
N191,response_20,"any lump in the penis should warrant a medical examination. given your description, it's difficult to determine what it could be. it could range from as simple as cyst to a possibility of a tumor. it doesn't sound like an emergency situation that would require immediate attention, such as extreme pain, loss of function, or progression in size over a very short period of time. so visiting an er might not be necessary. however, considering your concern and the location of the lump, i recommend you make an appointment with your primary care provider or visit a walk-in clinic as soon as possible. to better understand the lump, your physician might perform a physical exam, ultrasound or a biopsy if necessary. take care not to jump to conclusions or stress out unnecessarily before your appointment. it's always best to get a proper medical evaluation."
N191,response_21,"it's understandable to be worried about any new lumps, but it's important to remember that many are benign. your lump could be a cyst, a fibrous plaque due to peyronie's disease, a pinched vein, or another condition that is not cancerous. however, the only way to fully rule out penile cancer is to see a doctor.

since the lump is not causing any acute pain, bleeding or discharge, and you are not reporting any other symptoms that would signal an emergency, it is likely not necessary to go to the er. however, you should still seek medical attention as soon as you can. if you can't see your regular doctor right away, consider going to a walk-in clinic or urgent care center. these facilities can often help diagnose and treat common problems and can refer you to a specialist if needed.

in the meantime, monitor any changes in the lump or in your overall health. if you start to experience pain, burning, discharge, a change in shape or size of the lump, or other new symptoms, consider seeking immediate medical attention."
N191,response_22,"while finding a lump in the penis can be a cause for concern, it's important to remember that penile cancer is relatively rare. the lump could also be related to something less serious, like a cyst, an ingrown hair, a pearly penile papule, or peyronie's disease, which is a buildup of plaque or scar tissue inside the penis causing curve or bend in the penis when it is erect - this can also form a hard lump.

given your symptoms, it would be advisable to see a healthcare provider. while it doesn't seem like an emergency situation, you should aim to get an appointment as soon as possible, as it can alleviate your anxiety and help rule out any serious condition. you could visit a walk-in clinic if that is quicker. please disclose all of your symptoms and medical history to your healthcare provider, as they will be best suited to diagnose and guide you.

remember, self-diagnosis can cause unnecessary panic and anxiety. please see your doctor and have open conversation about your health."
N191,response_23,"i'm an ai language model and not a doctor, but i can provide general advice related to your question. 

you shouldn't panic about the lump. there are a lot of reasons for lumps to occur that are completely benign, including cysts, a blocked duct or swollen vein (which can happen if you've had something like an inflamed epididymus before), scar tissue from trauma or peyronie's disease, or even a fat deposit.

that being said, you should definitely get the lump checked out by your physician when they are available. because it is a new lump, it is not likely an emergency unless it significantly grows in size, becomes consistently and increasingly painful, or if you start to develop systemic symptoms like a fever.

penile cancer is extremely rare but itâ€™s always important to get changes checked by a doctor. in many cases, early detection will allow for more effective treatment. it's not advisable to rush to the er unless you feel severe pain, form additional abnormal symptoms, or you have urinary retention, signs of an infection (fevers, etc.), or other alarming symptoms. 

please remember, do not self-diagnose. no matter how minor the symptom, always consult with a healthcare professional. this information is not a replacement for a medical opinion."
N191,response_24,"first of all, you should not panic. there are several less serious conditions that could cause a lump on the penis. for instance, it could be peyronie's disease, which is a non-cancerous condition where fibrous scar tissue develops within the penis causing curved, painful erections. it could also be a penile cyst, which is a benign growth.

a small number of penile lumps are caused by more serious conditions like penile cancer or sexually transmitted infections, but these are usually accompanied by other symptoms like redness, pain, loss of appetite and weight loss.

however, any lump on the penis should be checked out by a medical professional just to be sure. you would typically need to visit your doctor for them to examine you and possibly run some tests, such as an ultrasound scan or a biopsy. you've correctly noted that this doesn't sound like an emergency situation, so visiting the er might not be necessary unless there is severe pain or if the lump is rapidly growing in size.

therefore, i would recommend making an appointment with your gp or visiting a walk-in center as soon as you can, so they can examine you and determine the next steps. as you mentioned, you've been screened for stis, so that's less likely - but again, only a healthcare professional can give you a definitive diagnosis. 

remember, most lumps are harmless, but it's always best to get them checked out just to be safe."
N191,response_25,"by your description it sounds like it might be a fibrous plaque, associated with a condition called peyronie's disease, where hard plaques form in the tissue of the penis. however, this is a tentative diagnosis and without a direct examination, it's difficult to establish the accurate cause of this lump. 

penile cancer is relatively rare, but in most cases presents as a lump that grows, and changes over time - which doesn't seem to match your symptom. however, getting it examined by a doctor to hope to rule out this possibility is a wise choice.

while it doesn't sound like a medical emergency, do contact your doctor as soon as possible to address your concern. you may want to consider heading to a walk-in center if experiencing any discomfort or if you are feeling anxious for a quicker appointment - but this will be at your own discretion. 

remember, only an in-person examination can provide a proper diagnosis and treatment plan. don't let online advice replace a direct medical consultation."
