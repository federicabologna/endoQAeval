N166,response_1,"respiration rate is not typically calculated using automatic blood pressure or pulse oximeter devices. it is usually measured by observation over the course of a minute. the healthcare professional may watch your chest or abdomen rise and fall, or feel your breaths while they are listening to your heart or lungs. an average rate for an adult at rest is between 12 and 20 breaths per minute. 

if you were talking while your respiratory rate was being calculated, 18 breaths per minute might not be an inaccurate reading, as speaking does increase your respiratory rate. however, if you were at rest and not hyperventilating, and you have consistently measured your rate to be between 9-10 breaths per minute, it's plausible that there might have been an error in the measurement.

next time, it might be worth having a conversation about this with the person taking your vital signs. they could then take your respiratory rate when you're quiet and at rest, perhaps at the very beginning or end of the visit."
N166,response_2,"respiration rate is typically assessed manually based on visible chest movements or the patient's breath sounds, so there might be some room for observer error. it's not usually measured by automatic blood pressure devices or pulse oximeters. 

speaking during the measurement probably affected the result, as talking often increases the respiration rate. 

on the other hand, it's also possible that the numbers were transposed (18 instead of 8) because 9-10 breaths per minute is actually lower than the normal range (12-20 breaths per minute for a relaxed adult), and 18 would be considered standard.

you can always ask your healthcare provider to double-check next time to ensure the most accurate measurements."
N166,response_3,"respiration rate is typically determined through observation, meaning a healthcare provider will watch your chest rise and fall to count the number of respirations per minute. the person measuring does not necessarily need to inform you that they are doing it in order to get an accurate count. talking can increase the respiration rate, but most healthcare professionals are trained to take that into account when they assess a patient.

that said, there can be inaccuracies and in your case, it's possible that either the tech made an error in counting, or they standardized the number. for adults, a normal respiration rate can vary between 12 to 20 breaths per minute, so it's often a practice to write down a ""default"" value somewhere around this range if the patient appears to be breathing normally.

the devices you mentioned - the automatic blood pressure device and the pulse oximeter - do not usually measure respiratory rates. however, there are some specific models of these devices that may have a feature to measure respiration rate, but it's not common.

if you believe your respiration rate is indeed lower than this and you're concerned about the accuracy of your records, it would be worth mentioning it to your doctor or the nurse on your next visit."
N166,response_4,"the respiration rate is typically determined by observation, and not usually by an automatic device such as a blood pressure monitor or pulse oximeter. the medical technician or nurse would observe your breaths while doing other tasks, often while taking your pulse, and count the number of breaths you take in one minute.

while there are more sophisticated monitoring devices that can measure respiration rate, they're usually used in critical care or surgical settings, not in a routine clinic visit scenario.

having a conversation during this process could potentially affect the rate if it caused you to breathe more quickly than at rest. additionally, there may be other factors, such as anxiety or physical activity prior to the observation, that could cause a temporary increase in breathing rate.

it's also possible that the rate was estimated or recorded inaccurately. the normative values for adult respiration rate vary, with some textbooks suggesting 12-20 breaths per minute as normal, so 18 may have just been an estimate within this normal range.

if you believe the recorded rate is not representative of your normal breathing at rest, it may be worth bringing it up for discussion at your next visit to ensure accurate records. however, a single measurement of elevated respiration in a resting, non-ill adult, is often not clinically relevant unless it is persistently increased or associated with other symptoms."
N166,response_5,"respiration rate is typically measured manually by observing the patient's breathing pattern. it's possible that the tech observed your breaths and counted them, or perhaps simply estimated based on general observations. even simple actions such as talking can temporarily increase your respiratory rate.

neither a standard automatic blood pressure device (which measures heart rate and bp) nor a pulse oximeter (which measures oxygen saturation and pulse rate) is designed to measure respiration rate.

if you were engaged in conversation, this could have certainly elevated your respiratory rate compared to when you're at rest and not talking. 

however, there could also be a chance of observational or recording error. if you still have concerns about the recorded respiration rate, i would recommend discussing this with your doctor or the medical staff for clarification."
N166,response_6,"respiration rate is typically determined by direct observation, either by a healthcare provider or by a medical assistant. to measure it, they count the number of times your chest rises and falls in a minute; each chest rise equals one breath. during this, talking can indeed artificially inflate the count, leading to higher numbers than usual.

as you suspected, neither an automatic blood pressure device nor a pulse oximeter directly measures respiration rate. while some advanced pulse oximeters and other devices can provide estimates of respiration rate using processing algorithms, these methods are not commonly used in routine office practice, and they're not as accurate as direct observation.

that said, it's also important to remember that respiration rate readings can be inaccurate or inconsistent for a variety of reasons. in many cases, professionals might not have the time to measure for full minute, or they may be distracted while counting. 

it is recommended to do a self-measurement of your respiratory rate while at rest and not talking for more precise results, and you can also talk to your doctor about any discrepancies for clarity."
N166,response_7,"the respiration rate is likely assessed through observation, as neither the automatic blood pressure device nor the pulse oximeter measure respiration rate. technicians typically measure this by watching your chest rise and fall. however, the rate could potentially increase during conversation or other forms of physical exertion.

if you still have doubts, i recommend you discuss this issue with the healthcare professionals at the office. they should be able to provide clarification about how they measure and record respiratory rate."
N166,response_8,"it's hard to definitively say how your respiration rate was calculated without specific knowledge of the methods used in the doctor's office you visited. however, i can provide some general information that may be helpful.

usually, respiration rate is measured by observing the patient. this involves watching the rise and fall of the patient's chest and counting the number of breaths taken in one minute. in some cases, a physician or nurse might measure your respiratory rate while pretending to count your pulse as patients can unknowingly alter their breathing if they know it's being watched. 

you mentioned a tech used a pulse oximeter and an automatic blood pressure device during your visit to the hematologist. while most pulse oximeters don't have a built-in feature for measuring respirations, certain higher-end models have the ability to measure ""respiration rate from pleth"" (rrp), which uses photoplethysmography signals to analyse respiratory patterns. however, these are not very common, especially in outpatient settings, so this might not be applicable in your situation.

engaging in conversation does not typically affect your respiratory rate significantly, but it can introduce additional variability. being in a medical setting (and thus potentially anxious) might also temporarily increase your respiratory rate. 

in conclusion, the most probable explanation is they have measured your respiration manually. if you're concerned about the accuracy of your respiration rate, it might be worth discussing with your healthcare provider."
N166,response_9,"usually respiratory rates are counted manually, the tech would watch either your chest or your abdomen rise and fall to count the number of breaths you took in one minute. this may have been done while you weren't looking or didn't notice, which is often done intentionally so the patient does not consciously or subconsciously alter their breathing pattern. 

both speaking and anxiety can cause an increase in respiratory rate, so it's possible your rate was higher than normal during the office visit. 

neither the automated blood pressure device nor the pulse oximeter can directly measure respiratory rate. however, newer models of pulse oximeters can estimate respiratory rate through a technology called respiration rate from the photoplethysmogram (rrp), but this is usually present in more specialized healthcare settings and not typically in a regular doctor’s office.

it's also possible the number was an estimation or even an error made by the medical staff. if you have a concern, i would recommend addressing it with your physician during your next appointment."
N166,response_10,"in most healthcare settings, including physicians' offices, a healthcare professional, such as a nurse or medical assistant, measures the respiratory rate manually. this is done by observing the patient's chest rise and fall for one full minute.

in your case, it’s possible that your respiration rate was estimated while you were engaged in conversation, which could have led to a higher recorded rate because people often breathe more rapidly when they speak. 

while some advanced medical devices, especially those used in critical care settings or during surgery, can automatically measure respiratory rate, it's less common for this to be the case with a standard pulse oximeter or blood pressure monitor used in a routine outpatient setting.

keep in mind that there's a range of normal for respiratory rates, and a variety of factors can influence it, including age, health status, and activity level. 

however, if you ever notice what feels like a significant discrepancy, it’s always okay to ask the healthcare professional for clarification or to take the measurement again."
N166,response_11,"typically, respiration rate is measured manually by observing the rise and fall of the patient's chest or abdomen. it's often measured when the patient is at rest and not aware that their breathing is being observed, as knowing they're being watched can sometimes alter their breathing pattern. hospitals and some clinics do have more sophisticated monitoring equipment that can automatically measure respiration rate, but it's not commonly used in most physician's offices. 

the conversation you were having with the tech could have potentially influenced your breathing rate if it was being measured manually, as speaking can often result in more frequent, shallow breaths. it's also possible there could have been a misunderstanding or error when recording the measurement.

neither an automatic blood pressure device nor a pulse oximeter are designed to measure respiration rate directly. while some advanced oximeters can estimate respiration rate based on changes in the volume of blood in the vessels with each breath, this is not a common feature in most models used in physicians’ offices.

if you're concerned about the accuracy of your respiration rate measurement, it might be worthwhile to bring it up during your next visit or in a phone call. your doctor or a nurse could measure it for you under more controlled conditions."
N166,response_12,"respiration rate is generally determined through simple observation, usually by a medical professional watching your chest rise and fall as you breathe. they might count the number of breaths in a minute, or sometimes count over a shorter amount of time and then multiply to estimate a per-minute rate. it is certainly possible that your respiration rate was slightly elevated because you were speaking, or even due to “white coat syndrome” (anxiety in a medical setting). neither the automatic blood pressure device nor the pulse oximeter is designed to assess respiration rate. however, certain high-end hospital models of these devices can provide additional measurements like respiration rate but these aren't typically used in a regular physician's office. the reported number could also have been an error, either in observation or in charting. if you feel it is inaccurate and are concerned, i would recommend discussing it with your doctor at your next appointment. they might be willing to remeasure, or they might consider your typical at-home measurements when discussing your respiratory health."
N166,response_13,"respiration rate is typically recorded by visual observation, meaning the healthcare provider or tech count the number of breaths per minute. however, it's important to note that talking or being slightly active can cause this number to increase.

automatic blood pressure cuff devices and pulse oximeters do not calculate respiration rate. the blood pressure cuff only measures systolic and diastolic blood pressures, and pulse oximeters measure heart rate (pulse) and oxygen saturation level in the blood. 

respiration rate of 18 breaths per minute is a standard, average number that is often default for adult patients if not specifically measured or if the patient's breathing is not obviously abnormal or significantly faster/slower. it could be possible this number was used as a default in your case.

however, if you find discrepancies like this and you feel worried, you should directly talk to your doctor or his office for clarification to make sure there are no mistakes or misunderstandings."
N166,response_14,"it seems like your respiration rate was likely measured simply by observation. this is the most common method used in clinical settings, where the healthcare provider will watch your chest rise and fall and count the breaths per minute.

engaging in conversation can certainly influence the respiration rate because we usually breathe more quickly when talking. it is possible that the healthcare provider may have inadvertently raised your respiration rate by talking with you during this time.

neither the automatic blood pressure device nor the pulse oximeter can directly measure respiration rate. however, some advanced types of pulse oximeters can indirectly estimate the respiration rate by detecting subtle changes in the pulse waveform that occur with each breath, but this is not a thoroughly reliable method.

it's also important to note that while a respiration rate of 18 might be higher than your resting state, it is still within the normal range for adults which is typically 12-20 breaths per minute. however, if you believe there is a significant discrepancy, you should bring this up with your healthcare provider. 

also, please remember to have discussions with your healthcare team regarding any concerns about accuracy of health measurements during your visits. they would best know the nuances of the devices they used and could possibly recalibrate during a time of rest to get what might be a more accurate reading for you specifically."
N166,response_15,"respiration rate in a typical doctor's office setting is usually measured by simple observation, with the healthcare provider counting the number of breaths a patient takes in a minute. often, they do this while pretending to take your pulse so as not to make you conscious about your breathing.

automatic blood pressure devices and pulse oximeters do not typically measure respiration rate. the blood pressure device measures systolic and diastolic blood pressure, while the pulse oximeter measures oxygen saturation and pulse rate. however, some more advanced pulse oximeters can also estimate respiratory rate based on pulse signal but it's not common in regular doctor's offices.

if the healthcare professional or tech was engaged in conversation with you, this might indeed have increased your respiration rate. talking can cause a person to breathe more rapidly than when resting quietly. 

to accurately determine your resting respiration rate, it's best measured when you're at rest and not talking. if you're ever curious about it, you could also count it yourself at home while you're calm and resting, by counting the number of times your chest rises in one minute.

considering the variability of this measure and the potential impact of several factors (conversation, nervousness, having just walked, etc.), a breathing rate of 18 while at the doctor's office does not necessarily indicate a problem, especially if you have no symptoms of respiratory distress, like shortness of breath, fast and shallow breathing, chest pain, etc."
N166,response_16,"the respiration rate is usually measured by observation, with the medical professional watching and counting the patient's breaths per minute. it's possible that your respiration rate was elevated due to being in a new environment or from speaking during your visit, which can cause more rapid breathing. it's also possible that an incorrect respiration rate was noted, as human error can occur in any setting. neither the automatic blood pressure device nor the pulse oximeter directly measure a person's respiration rate. if you believe this may be an error, it might be worth mentioning it to your doctor or the professional involved in your care. you should also feel free to ask them directly how they measure your respiration rate during future visits to ensure the most accurate reporting."
N166,response_17,"in most settings, respiratory rate is determined by observing your breaths. the medical assistant or nurse will observe your chest rise and fall, often under the guise of taking your pulse, so that you don't become conscious of your breathing and alter the rate. this whole process should ideally last for a full minute to get an accurate measure.

automatic blood pressure devices and pulse oximeters do not usually measure respiration rate. however, some advanced monitors can indirectly estimate respiration rate by sensing small oscillations in the pulse or blood pressure signal that correspond to your breathing. 

that being said, an error could have been made or perhaps your breathing rate increased during the visit due to conversation, stress or any other factors. 

if you continue to believe there is a discrepancy, i'd advise you to discuss it with your doctor, either for the possible relevance it may have to your health or to get a more accurate chart."
N166,response_18,"in an outpatient office, respiration rate is typically measured through observing the patient's inhales and exhales for a period of one minute. this could have occurred while the tech was taking your blood pressure or while they were using the pulse oximeter. 

the tech could also have asked you to breathe normally and then counted your breaths. however, patients often change their breathing patterns when they know they are being observed, and this could result in an inaccurate reading.

engaging in conversation could have also definitely affected your respiration rate, as we tend to take quicker and more shallow breaths when talking. 

the pulse oximeter measures the level of oxygen in your blood and pulse rate, but it doesn’t directly measure your respiration rate - although there are some advanced medical devices that can provide respiration rate in addition to these measures.

if you are concerned about the respiration rate noted in your chart, you may want to discuss it with your doctor or ask to have it re-measured. your own measurements at resting rate while not talking could also be different from the in-office visit. if you consistently monitor it to be different than reported, do let your doctor know. they could guide you more on what exactly might affect and varies the rate."
N166,response_19,"respiration rate is typically determined through direct observation, with a healthcare provider counting the number of breaths a patient takes per minute. it's possible the tech was keeping track while engaging in conversation with you, or while you were otherwise distracted. 

however, it should be noted that talking can increase your respiration rate, as can other factors like physical activity, anxiety, or certain medical conditions. 

neither the blood pressure monitor nor the pulse oximeter would directly measure respiration rate, although some pulse oximeter models can estimate it based on changes in blood oxygen saturation levels. 

if there's a significant discrepancy in what you believe your respiration rate to be and what was noted in your medical records, it might be worth bringing to the attention of your healthcare provider. that said, a rate of 18 breaths per minute, while slightly higher than average for a resting adult, is still well within the normal range."
N166,response_20,"the respiration rate captured in the clinic setting is typically done via observation. the medical tech or nurse will often look at your chest or stomach rise and fall and count the number of breaths you take per minute. usually, this is done while you are distracted by something else, like when your blood pressure is being taken or a conversation is going on, because if most people know you're observing their breathing, it becomes altered. automatic blood pressure devices or pulse oximeters typically do not measure respiration rate.

being engaged in conversation could certainly cause a temporary increase in your respiratory rate, as could stress, anxiety, or even movement. if you were standing just prior to the measurement or feeling anxious during the clinic visit these can cause temporarily increased rates.

however, a note of caution: counting your own respiration rate can also lead to inaccuracies as most people unconsciously slow their breathing if they are aware it is being monitored. you might try counting your breaths while distracted by a television show or book to get a more accurate at-rest rate.

for a healthy adult, a respiratory rate of between 12 to 20 breaths per minute is considered normal. having a rate of 18 breaths per minute is within this normal range. 

if you're concerned about the rate, you might want to bring it up at your next visit for reassurance. it's always a good idea to bring up any concerns or questions you have about your health with your physician. they can offer more detailed advice and insight tailored to your specific condition."
N166,response_21,"the respiration rate is generally measured by physical observation. during a clinical visit, a healthcare provider will usually take this measurement by quietly observing your chest rising and falling. this method of measurement is standardized and should be reasonably reliable. however, factors such as talking, anxiety, or activity can cause your respiration rate to increase transiently, which could've likely contributed to the higher number in your case. neither the automatic blood pressure device or the pulse oximeter directly measures respiration rate.

its also worth noting that values seen in medical record, especially in busy clinical settings, sometimes are estimates or 'default' values if the patient appears to be in no distress. also, guidelines suggest that normal respiratory rate for adults can vary between 12 to 20 breaths per minute, while resting. however, individual differences are common and can be lower or higher than this, especially in people who are physically fit or practice slow and deep breathing exercises. it might be worthwhile to discuss this concern with your provider during your next visit."
N166,response_22,"respiration rate is traditionally measured by observing the number of breaths taken within a minute. usually, the healthcare personnel would discretely observe your chest rise and fall while they are also checking your pulse, to get an accurate count.

in some advanced healthcare settings, respiration rate can also be monitored indirectly via certain machines such as pulse oximeters or capnographs. the pulse oximeter measures heart rate and oxygen saturation, but not respiration rate directly, however, some sophisticated models may have indirect measurement of the respiration rate. 

that being said, it's quite likely that your respiration rate was recorded from simple observation, or even estimated based on typical adult values. it's important to note that having a conversation or any activity can elevate your respiration rate, so it's possible that the rate was higher than your resting rate during the checkup.

however, since you were aware of your own typical respiration rate and you believe there's a discrepancy, you should definitely bring it up with your healthcare provider to clarify. they may want to recheck it under different circumstances or re-evaluate how they recorded it."
N166,response_23,"respiration rate is typically assessed and recorded by observation, it's not usually measured by a blood pressure device or pulse oximeter. health professionals will watch for the rise and fall of your chest or feel it by placing their hands on your chest. 

it's possible that your respiration rate was higher than normal at the time because of various factors like anxiety or engaging in conversation. however, if the person who recorded it didn't observe you for a full minute (which they often don't in a busy clinic), they may have just estimated or taken a standard number. 

it appears like 18 breaths per minute is pretty average for a resting adult. standards can vary, but in general, a normal rate for an adult at rest can be between 12 to 20 breaths per minute. 

that being said, if you're often around 9 or 10, you have a slower than average resting respiratory rate. this is not necessarily a bad thing, especially if you're in good health and do regular physical activity. some activities like yoga and meditation can lower your respiratory rate.  

if you're concerned about the incorrect recording, you can bring it up at your next visit or call the office to clarify."
N166,response_24,"the respiration rate is typically measured by a medical professional by visual observation. they watch your chest rise and fall, and count the breaths you take in a minute. the blood pressure device and pulse oximeter do not measure respiratory rate.

the respiration rate may be affected by a variety of factors, like if you are talking or if you're nervous/anxious. it's possible that your rate was higher than usual because you were engaged in conversation. also, the accuracy of the measurement can depend on the observer's experience and attentiveness.

therefore, the respiration rate you saw was likely either a quickly estimated number or possibly mistaken. if it's of concern, you can ask your healthcare provider about it during your next visit."
N166,response_25,"your respiration rate during your visit was most likely calculated by direct observation, which involves counting the number of breaths you take in a minute. it's true that speaking could possibly increase your respiratory rate if you were actively engaged in conversation when your respiration was being monitored. however, the commonly accepted range for adult respiration rate is between 12 and 20 breaths per minute, so a report of 18 breaths per minute is within the normal range for an adult of your age and physical condition. 

neither an automatic blood pressure measurement device nor a pulse oximeter directly measures respiration rate. a pulse oximeter measures the level of oxygen in your blood and your pulse rate, while a blood pressure cuff measures systolic and diastolic blood pressure.

about your personal monitoring, note that when you actively try to count your own breathing, you might subconsciously slow your breath, which could explain why your measurement is lower. always consult with your healthcare provider if you have concerns about your vital signs."
