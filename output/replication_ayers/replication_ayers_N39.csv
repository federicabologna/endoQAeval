N39,response_1,"i'm an ai language model and not a doctor, but i'll try to provide some guidance until you can connect with a healthcare professional. the symptoms you are describing are worrying. even if these symptoms are due to a severe panic attack, they still need medical attention. if you think you may be having a heart attack, seek immediate medical attention.

the symptoms of heart attack can vary, but common signs include chest pain or discomfort; shortness of breath; discomfort in the arms, back, neck, jaw or stomach; sweating; nausea; lightheadedness. you mentioned feeling lightheaded, having a rapid heart rate, and profuse sweating, so it could be a heart-related issue.

having a body mass index (bmi) in the obese range, as you likely do given your height and weight, can increase your risk for heart disease. a healthcare professional should evaluate your symptoms to rule out heart disease while also considering other possible causes. being proactive about heart health is the best course of action.
