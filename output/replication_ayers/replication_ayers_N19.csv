N19,response_1,"i'm an ai and not a doctor, but based on your symptoms, it seems necessary that you seek out professional medical advice. these events could potentially be related and are severe symptoms that should not be ignored. since you're not feeling heard or validated by some healthcare providers and your parents, consider seeking another opinion. you might want to consult with a neurologist, who specializes in disorders of the nervous system, including seizures and migraines. it's crucial to trust your own experiences and feelings about your health. if you're unable to get immediate medical assistance, it may also be worth seeking help from a trusted adult or friend who can accompany you or advocate for your needs. you should also contact your physician if you develop any new symptoms."
N19,response_2,"i'm really sorry to hear you're going through this. it's important to listen to your body and advocate for your own health. while i can provide some general guidance based on your symptoms, it's crucial to remember that i'm an ai trained by doctors, and my advice doesn't replace a personal medical consultation.

your symptoms certainly could be indicative of a seizure followed by a migraine, but other conditions may also present similar symptoms. you've described post-seizure symptoms like severe muscle aches, confusion, and strong emotional reactions. you've also described symptoms that could be associated with migraines including a one-sided headache, light and sound sensitivity, and visual disturbances, that lasted more than a day.

they might be related or could be two separate conditions. seizures and migraines can, indeed, sometimes be connected - they may have common pathophysiological mechanisms, and people who have migraines are more likely to have seizures.

but you really need a thorough medical evaluation. if your nurse practitioner doesn't take you seriously, consider seeking a second opinion. it might help to seek input from a neurologist who specializes in seizures and migraines. you might need some testing (like eeg, mri) to confirm the diagnosis and further guide the treatment.

this isn't something you should ignore. 
please consult a healthcare professional promptly."
N19,response_3,"i'm really sorry to hear that you're feeling unheard and dismissed, as well as dealing with these hard symptoms. i'm an ai assistant built by openai, so i'm not a doctor, but i can share that you may want to seek additional medical opinions and support. 

the symptoms you described could be consistent with a seizure or migraine, both of which should be evaluated by a medical professional, especially if they're new developments for you. seizures can sometimes be followed by a headache, fatigue, confusion, and sore muscles. migraines can also cause sensitivity to sound and light, dizziness, blurred vision, and cognitive changes. 

it's also possible for migraines and seizures to be related. migraine is considered a risk factor for seizure, and seizure is a risk factor for migraine. it's important to note that not all seizures involve convulsions - there are nonconvulsive seizures that could present differently.

regardless, you should reach out to a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and treatment, as both seizures and migraines are serious conditions that need appropriate care. try reaching out to a neurologist if you haven't already, and keep track of all your symptoms in a diary, along with the dates and times they occur, to aid in your diagnosis.

if you're having any trouble affording healthcare due to being on your parents' insurance, there may be resources in your area that can help ensure you get the care you need. try researching local health clinics, health departments, or hospitals for free or discounted services.

please reach out to a healthcare provider to discuss your concerns."
N19,response_4,"i'm sorry to hear that you're going through this. it's important to remember that while i can give some general advice, i'm an ai and not a doctor. given your symptoms and experiences, it is critical that you receive professional medical attention. if your family or healthcare provider are being dismissive, it would be in your best interest to see another doctor. don't let anyone discourage you from seeking the appropriate treatment. you need to listen to your body and you have a right to seek help when you're suffering. persistent headaches, a history of seizure, and symptoms such as dizziness, light and sound sensitivity, and vision changes are all things that need thorough investigation by healthcare professionals. reach out to a neurologist or another doctor that you trust who can properly evaluate your symptoms and come up with a treatment plan."
N19,response_5,"i'm an ai language model developed by openai, not a doctor, but i can provide some general advice for you. your symptoms and experience are concerning and should absolutely be evaluated by a healthcare professional. while it's possible that you fainted, the description of your symptoms could indeed be consistent with a tonic-clonic seizure. as for your migraines, they can sometimes be related to seizures, but a proper diagnosis is necessary. you should not ignore these issues. if your parents and current np won't take you seriously, you might need to seek a second opinion or see a neurologist. they can run tests like blood work, eeg, and mri to rule out any serious conditions. be sure to provide all relevant medical history and describe your symptoms in detail. 

remember while this advice is based on medical knowledge, it's crucial to contact a healthcare professional. it’s important to seek help even if others aren’t taking you seriously. your health and well-being are most important, and you know your body better than anyone else. if something doesn’t feel right, you're right to pursue answers."
N19,response_6,"i'm really sorry to hear you're going through this. it's important to feel heard and taken seriously, especially when you're experiencing health issues. what you're describing does sound concerning. seizures and migraines can be related, as they both involve abnormal brain activity. they can even occur together in a condition known as migralepsy, although this is quite rare.

you clearly understand the necessity of getting a proper diagnosis and treatment. don't allow discouragement from others to prevent you from seeking the medical help you need. even under your parents' insurance, you still have the right to see a different doctor for a second opinion if you're not satisfied with your np's response.

go to an er, especially if you have another seizure or a severe headache with neurological symptoms like vision changes. you can also reach out to a neurologist directly. they specialize in brain and nervous system disorders and would be better skilled at diagnosing these sorts of issues.

your health is too important to ignore. i encourage you to listen to your body and seek a second opinion."
N19,response_7,"i'm an ai language model, not a doctor, but based on your description, your symptoms could potentially be a cause for concern. tonic-clonic seizures, migraines, and the other symptoms you mention can sometimes indicate an underlying neurological condition. it's also worth mentioning that migraines and seizures can accompany each other in some disorders. however, only a trained medical professional can provide an accurate diagnosis. 

you should definitely seek a second opinion if you feel you're not being taken seriously, or if your symptoms persist or worsen. going to the emergency room or contacting a different healthcare provider to discuss your symptoms immediately might be wise. you could also potentially seek out a neurologist specifically, as they specialize in conditions affecting the brain and nervous system. 

please remember that this is a general advice and shouldn't be used as a replacement for medical advice. hope you get the care you need soon."
N19,response_8,"i'm an ai language model, not a doctor, but it seems like it would be useful to seek a second medical opinion given your experience. symptoms such as those from a migraine (light and sound sensitivity, dizziness, vision changes) have been known to correlate with seizures in some people, as both conditions affect the nervous system. assuming it was a tonic-clonic seizure, it can take some time to recover, and could potentially be related to the later headache. regardless, it's important to get an accurate diagnosis because proper treatment can depend on it. you should discuss these symptoms with a neurological professional who can order tests such as eeg (for seizures) and mri or ct scans (to rule out other underlying causes such as tumors). 

remember, while it can be tough when the people around you are not taking your symptoms seriously, it's crucial to advocate for your own health. consider going to the doctor with a written list of symptoms and a timeline of events to help facilitate the conversation."
N19,response_9,"i'm an ai, but i can offer some advice. both tonic-clonic seizures and migraines can be signs of neurological issues that could be serious, so it's important that you get appropriate medical attention. the rhythmic jerkiness of a tonic-clonic seizure and the post-ictal (post-seizure) state that you describe, as well as your first migraine, suggest that you could benefit from speaking to a neurologist. you may need tests such as an mri or an eeg. in the interim, avoid triggers, get good sleep, eat balanced meals, hydrate well, and reduce stress. do remember that your understanding and experiences of your health matter and you have the right to seek out the best help. try talking to your parents and your doctor again, patiently explaining your symptoms and your concerns. if they continue to dismiss you, try to seek help elsewhere - perhaps contact such organizations as the epilepsy foundation or the migraine trust for advice. please consult with a healthcare professional if you can."
N19,response_10,"i'm really sorry to hear you're going through this. it sounds quite distressing and i understand why you're concerned. based on what you've described, it would be best for you to seek a second opinion from another healthcare professional. what you've experienced could certainly be related and warrants further investigation. 

unfortunately, as a language ai model, i can't physically assess your condition or order tests. therefore, please consider finding a healthcare professional who will take your symptoms and concerns seriously. tonic-clonic seizures and migraines can be serious conditions, and often their relationship is not clear and requires further medical evaluation."
N19,response_11,"i'm an ai developed by openai, and while i can't replace a professional healthcare provider's advice, i can suggest that you persist in seeking medical attention. you're experiencing symptoms that are significant and need to be addressed by healthcare professionals. if the nurse practitioner you saw isn't taking your symptoms seriously, then seeking a second opinion might be necessary. seeing a neurologist or a headache specialist could be beneficial. it's important to remember that both seizures and migraines can be serious conditions which may need further workup, diagnosis, and treatment. 

it's unfortunate that people around you are not taking your symptoms seriously, but it's crucial that you stay persistent in taking care of your health. please reach out to a professional healthcare provider directly to get a comprehensive evaluation of your situation. you're the best judge of what's normal for you and when something doesn't feel right.

but considering you have continued symptoms, worsening headache, and have a new diagnosis of migraine, a visit to a neurologist is strongly advised. if you don't have immediate access to a neurologist, go to an emergency department, especially if you have severe headache, unbearable pain or any new neurological symptoms. your parents' insurance should cover necessary tests and consultations.

this is not a substitute for professional medical advice. please reach out to a healthcare provider."
N19,response_12,"i'm really sorry to hear that you're going through this, and it must be incredibly frustrating not to be taken seriously. your symptoms do sound concerning, and it's essential that they're properly evaluated. while i'm an ai and can't offer a diagnosis, i would highly recommend seeking a second medical opinion. 

please don't let anyone discourage you from seeking medical attention. it could be helpful to consult with a neurologist who specializes in seizures and headaches/migraines. they can potentially order tests such as an eeg, mri, or ct scan to understand what might be happening.

your parents' denial or downplaying of your symptoms doesn't change the reality of what you're experiencing. you're not alone in this, and there's no need to feel crazy. this definitely needs to be checked out further by a healthcare professional. i can't reiterate this enough: trust your body and your gut feeling. seek further medical attention as soon as you can.  

however, if you have another seizure, go to the emergency department right away. don't try to handle it at home."
N19,response_13,"i'm an ai and my answer can't replace professional medical advice, but i can say that your symptoms sound serious and shouldn't be ignored. your symptoms may indicate a serious neurological issue, such as a seizure disorder or a potential vascular issue causing migraines. it's also possible to have both conditions separately. your next steps should be to consult with a specialist. if possible, a neurologist would be able to properly diagnose and treat your condition. even if it's difficult, it's important to advocate for yourself and your health. headaches, especially with visual or sensory changes, can be neurologically important and you should most likely have them checked out. calling a nurse advice line, a 24/7 medical helpline, or getting urgent care may also be options for you. please be persistent, and if you start having more frequent episodes or worsening symptoms, go to the er."
N19,response_14,"i'm an ai developed by openai and while i'm not a doctor, i can provide some general advice based on the information given. 

experiencing a tonic-clonic seizure for the first time, especially when it is unprovoked (not related to drug use, trauma or other explicit causes), is indeed reason for concern. this should be thoroughly investigated by a neurologist who could review your medical history, symptoms, and potentially conduct tests such as eegs or mris to help determine the cause.

since then you've developed migraine-like symptoms. frequent severe headaches along with other neurological symptoms definitely warrant medical investigation, although it doesn't necessarily mean that they are linked. 

i recommend seeking further medical advice from a professional, potentially a different one if you feel like your concerns are not being taken seriously. if the seizure recurs, or if you experience prolonged neurological symptoms such as confusion, weakness, or changes in vision, you should seek emergency medical attention.

i encourage you to continue trying to speak to a medical professional about your concerns. remember: it's important to advocate for your own health."
N19,response_15,"i'm really sorry to hear you're going through this. i'm an ai, but based on the details you've provided, it does sound like you've experienced a tonic-clonic seizure and a possible migraine. both are indeed serious medical conditions that require further investigation and appropriate monitoring and treatment. migraines and seizures are both neurological disorders and it's not unheard of for a person to have both. you should try to see a neurologist, who specializes in such matters as soon as possible. you may need further investigations like an eeg (electroencephalogram) to check your brain's electrical activity and an mri scan to rule out any structural abnormalities in your brain. it's important to understand that you know your body best and these symptoms should not be disregarded or taken lightly. please take care of yourself and seek the necessary medical attention."
N19,response_16,"i'm an ai developed by openai, and while i can provide some general advice and information based on what you've shared, it's important to find a healthcare provider who can evaluate you properly. if you're having symptoms and experiences that significantly worry you, it's crucial to seek professional medical advice. it seems you're in a challenging situation, since you're feeling dismissed by your family and current healthcare provider. if you're 21, you should have a right to seek medical care on your own.

from what you've described with your first experience, it does seem like it could be a tonic-clonic seizure. in a tonic-clonic seizure, an individual may lose consciousness, stiffen, and have jerking movements, along with temporary symptoms after the seizure such as headache, confusion, fatigue, and more. it's crucial to get evaluated by a neurologist who is specialized in seizures and epilepsy for proper assessment, investigation and management.

in regard to your headache, it's also possible that it's a migraine, but again, you should see a medical professional to get a proper diagnosis. typically, migraines present as moderate to severe headaches usually on one side of the head, that can last for hours to days, and can be associated with nausea, sensitivity to light, sound, or smells.

both seizures and migraines can be related to abnormal activity in the brain, and they can have shared triggers, such as stress, lack of sleep, certain foods, hormonal changes, etc. sometimes, they can occur together in what's known as migralepsy, but this is quite rare.

remember, my advice is only informational and you should seek advice from a healthcare professional. if your primary care provider is not giving the attention you think you deserve, you can seek a second opinion from another primary care provider or a neurologist. as an adult, you have the right to choose your health provider. this should be easier if your health insurance allows self-referrals to specialists. depending on your situation, consider seeking the medical care and attention you need without relying solely on your parents' perspective or permission. it's your right and your health. good luck!"
N19,response_17,"i'm really sorry to hear that you're feeling dismissed and unsupported - it sounds like you're going through a lot right now. as an ai, i can't replace professional medical advice. however, symptoms like those you described are serious and should be assessed by a healthcare professional. seizures and migraines can have various causes, and the relationship between them is complex and not yet fully understood by the medical field. multiple studies suggest that there is a higher prevalence of migraines in people with epilepsy, and vice versa. so it's not uncommon for these two conditions to co-occur. i strongly recommend seeking a second opinion from another health professional. make sure to describe your symptoms as detailed as possible and provide them with a full medical history. if you experience another seizure, go to the emergency room immediately. they may be able to offer more emergency based treatment and could potentially initiate further neurological evaluation."
N19,response_18,"i'm sorry to hear about your health concerns. however, it's crucial to understand that while i can offer some guidance and direction, i cannot diagnose your condition online. what you have described does sound potentially serious, and you are right to want a thorough investigation.

the symptoms you are describing are concerning, and i would strongly urge you to follow up with a physician, preferably a neurologist, for further evaluation. based on the description, it seems like there could be a neurological component. you might need a brain scan or an eeg to check for abnormalities in the brain that might cause seizures or migraines. 

you are an adult and have the right to seek a second opinion if you feel your concerns are not being adequately addressed. you should trust your instincts when it comes to your health.

please seek medical help immediately."
N19,response_19,"i'm really sorry to hear you're going through this, it must be quite frightening. based on your description, you should definitely seek further medical advice. the severity and type of symptoms you've experienced, following a suspected seizure and now a severe headache that could be a migraine require professional evaluation.

you should ideally consult a neurologist. neurologists are experts in conditions that affect the brain and nerves like seizures and migraines. the combination of both these events in such close proximity could potentially signify a neurological problem. 

epilepsy is one potential cause of unprovoked seizures, while migraines can be standalone or be triggered by a variety of factors including stress, hormones, certain foods, or be related to other medical conditions. remember, it's important to push for the care you need and deserve, even if others have been dismissive.

please see a doctor as soon as possible and try to find a professional who will take your experiences seriously. it would be prudent to be especially mindful of any new or worsening symptoms until you manage to see a specialist. be well and take care."
N19,response_20,"i'm an ai but based on your symptoms, it certainly sounds like you've been through some frightening experiences and it's understandable that you'd be seeking professional advice and feeling worried. seek out an immediate consultation with a neurologist. you seem to have classic symptoms of a tonic-clonic seizure and migraines. these can often be linked as migraines can sometimes trigger seizures or a seizure can be followed by a headache or migraine. a neurologist will be able to give you more specifics, run the necessary tests like eegs, blood tests and ct or mri scans, and better quantify your risk. you should communicate your concerns to your parents and emphasize the need for immediate attention given the recent serious events. a visit to the er could also be an immediate option. remember to take care of yourself, look for any potential triggers for these episodes and try to avoid them if possible."
N19,response_21,"i'm an ai language model and can't replace advice from a healthcare professional, but it seems crucial that you get appropriate medical attention. seizures and migraines aren't typically events to ignore, as they could stem from a range of conditions, some severe. since what you've encountered seems to be a marked change from your usual health pattern, it would definitely be worth seeking out another healthcare provider if your current one is not taking your concerns seriously. if possible, consider seeing a neurologist, who typically has more knowledge about conditions affecting the brain and nervous system, including migraines and seizures."
N19,response_22,"i'm really sorry to hear what you're going through, and it's absolutely understandable to be feeling concerned. it's important to have any changes in health, especially ones like you've described such as seizures and symptoms similar to migraines, thoroughly investigated.

you're right that the symptoms you've described don't sound like a faint and do seem more consistent with a seizure. seizures and migraines can indeed be related or have common triggers, and they can sometimes even be symptoms of the same underlying condition. 

the first thing to do if you haven't already is to have a full neurological evaluation. this will likely include tests like an eeg (electroencephalogram) to look at electrical activity in your brain, and an mri scan to see if there's any physical cause for the symptoms you've experienced. 

to manage your current symptoms, over-the-counter painkillers and anti-nausea medications can help with headache and nausea, while a dark, quiet environment may help alleviate light and noise sensitivity.

it can be very challenging when those around you don’t appreciate the seriousness of what you’re going through. although it is important to communicate with your parents about your health concerns, ultimately, your health decisions are yours. if possible, you should seek out a second opinion. 

but remember that while online advice can be meaningful, personal advice from a doctor who knows you and your medical history, and who can do a physical examination is essential for proper medical advice. don't hesitate to go to the emergency room if you experience another event like the one you've described or if your symptoms seem to worsen.

you're not alone in this and your experiences are valid. you're actually doing the right thing by paying attention to your symptoms and asking for help."
N19,response_23,"i'm really sorry to hear you're going through this. it sounds like a very concerning ordeal. this forum isn't a substitute for professional medical advice, but i can share some general information which might help guide you.

tonic-clonic seizures and migraines can have some overlapping features such as changes in vision, headache, and sometimes even loss of consciousness. both are neurological events, and sometimes one can precede or trigger the other.

however, it's essential to get a proper diagnosis. and that means seeing a neurologist - ideally one who specializes in seizures and/or migraines. the symptoms you describe - prolonged unconsciousness, body stiffening, convulsions, bluish color, followed by confusion, fatigue, and headache - sounds much more like a tonic-clonic seizure than a fainting spell.

as for the migraine, its symptoms can also be severe and have neurological manifestations (like those you describe), and should be assessed.

i definitely understand the challenge you're feeling with your family and your primary care provider, but your own experience and your body's signals are incredibly important. your health matters and finding out what's going on is important. if possible, consider seeking a second opinion, perhaps from a different healthcare provider or clinic. seek immediate medical attention if you have another seizure or if your migraines become more severe or frequent.

based on what you've described, seeking a specialist's opinion would seem a very reasonable step. you are your own best advocate when it comes to your health and well-being. i hope you get the help and care you need. stay strong.

remember, though, this advice is intended to be general in nature, and specific causes may not apply to your situation. always consult with a healthcare provider for accurate information."
N19,response_24,"i'm an ai developed by openai, and while i can't examine or diagnose you, i can share that your symptoms certainly suggest a thorough medical evaluation is warranted. the symptoms you're experiencing – headache, unilateral facial pain, dizziness, sound/light sensitivity, and aura symptoms like blurred vision or lights – are indeed indicative of a migraine. the event you described seems to fit the symptoms of a tonic-clonic seizure. given that these episodes are new, concerning, and potentially dangerous, it is important to see a healthcare provider who can properly evaluate your condition. 

you should seek out a neurologist if possible, as they specialize in brain and nervous system disorders, including migraines and seizures. they may recommend tests like an eeg (electroencephalogram) to check for electric activity in the brain, or an mri to look for any possible brain abnormalities. further, having someone with you who witnessed these episodes could provide the healthcare provider with valuable information. 

remember that it's crucial to advocate for your health. if you feel that your symptoms are not being taken seriously, you may need to seek a second opinion. it's better to explore and rule out serious conditions than to underestimate them. it's also very important to keep in mind that while the internet and ai can provide information, it's vital to ensure you get an in-person evaluation by a medical professional."
N19,response_25,"i'm a language model ai developed by openai and i can provide some general assistance. the symptoms you're describing, such as the seizures, headaches, and other neurological symptoms, suggest that medical intervention is necessary. 

most importantly, a healthcare provider needs to determine what caused these symptoms to occur. while it's feasible that they might be connected, it's also possible that they're unrelated. 

you definitely aren't overreacting. please don't let anyone downplay your experiences. your symptoms should be taken seriously and managed appropriately.

you could:

1. visit an emergency department: this should be considered the option of choice if symptoms worsen or repeat themselves. 

2. a second opinion: if you feel your concerns aren't being addressed, seeking a second opinion from another healthcare provider can help get you the care you need. you could ideally consult a neurologist, who specializes in conditions of the nervous system and could potentially identify what might be causing these symptoms better.

it's important to note that discussing your personal and family history with a healthcare provider can also provide a more decisive diagnostic evaluation. 

always remember that getting a professional medical assessment in person will provide a much more accurate understanding of your condition."
