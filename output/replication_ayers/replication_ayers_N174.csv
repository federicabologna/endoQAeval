N174,response_1,"i'm a language model ai developed by openai, and while i'm not a doctor, i can advise you on the information you provided.

elevated blood sugar levels, such as what you're experiencing, can be concerning especially with a family history of type 2 diabetes and sedentary lifestyle conditions. these are common symptoms of hyperglycemia. however, a single high reading is not typically considered diagnostic.

the persistent thirst and dehydration is associated with high blood sugar. generally it's recommended to have repeated blood sugar checks over time to confirm the diagnosis.

steroids, even topical and oral like the medrol pack you took, can indeed raise blood sugar levels in some people, especially those who already have risk factors for diabetes.

this specific situation isn't an immediate emergency, but it should be addressed promptly. you should get in contact with your healthcare provider, let them know what's going on, and possibly set up an appointment for further testing. 

keep monitoring your blood sugar levels regularly and maintain good hydration. if you develop symptoms such as confusion, difficulty breathing, or repeated vomiting, seek immediate medical attention. 

but remember it's always best to consult with a healthcare professional for advice tailored specifically to you."
N174,response_2,"although blood sugar levels can fluctuate throughout the day due to factors like diet, exercise, and stress, your blood sugar level is quite high. normally, blood sugar levels for someone without diabetes are less than 140 mg/dl two hours after eating. 

you might not need to rush to the emergency room right now, but you should contact your healthcare provider promptly to discuss these measurements, especially given your family history of type 2 diabetes. your other symptoms, such as the increased thirst and feelings of bloating, should also be mentioned.

it's also quite possible that steroids, whether oral like medrol or topical like cortisone cream, can indeed elevate blood sugar levels. they can even lead to steroid-induced diabetes in some individuals.

it's crucial for you to follow up with your healthcare provider promptly so your situation can be evaluated fully. it'll be important to understand whether this was a one-off elevation due to various reasons like stress, steroids or whether it's indicative of developing diabetes. regular monitoring might be needed."
N174,response_3,"repeating your blood glucose level lets us know that your readings are consistent, so likely not a simple machine error. one reading over 200 could be a fluke- but having several readings stays over 200, would be more concerning. you're right to think your family history makes you at higher risk for developing type 2 diabetes.

while it's not an emergency, this definitely needs to be addressed. it may be a sign that you're developing diabetes, or less likely, it could be due to medications or illness. topical steroids aren't generally known to raise blood sugar levels, but systemic steroids (like your medrol pack) can.

thirst can be a symptom of high blood sugar, so be sure to hydrate well. it would be a good idea to call your doctor and inform him or her of these readings. they may want to run some lab testing, monitor your blood sugars more closely, or try some medication changes. make sure not to start or stop any medications without clearance from your doctor. your doctor knows your personal health history best and can provide the most accurate advice. 

in the meantime, you might want to try some lifestyle changes to lower blood sugar levels like cutting out refined carbohydrates and sugary drinks, eating more fiber, getting regular exercise and trying to lose weight if needed. keep monitoring your blood sugar levels and seek emergency medical attention if you have signs of diabetic ketoacidosis (dka), such as frequent urination, nausea, abdominal pain, fatigue or fruity-scented breath. this is a potentially life-threatening condition. don’t forget to contact your healthcare provider to discuss your symptoms and action plan."
N174,response_4,"this is not an immediate emergency, but a fasting blood sugar level consistently higher than 125 or a 2-hour post-meal level consistently 200 or higher does indicate diabetes. given your family history and reading, it would be wise to call and make an appointment with your doctor as soon as possible.

increased thirst, frequent urination, and feeling bloated can be symptoms of high blood sugar. however, these symptoms can also occur with other conditions, so it is important to confirm the diagnosis with a healthcare provider.

steroids, including topical ones, can increase blood sugar levels, so your topical cortisone and the medrol pack could be contributing, although 3 weeks after finishing the medrol pack, most of these effects should have worn off. 

your doctor will likely want to confirm the diagnosis with a fasting plasma glucose test or an hba1c test. these tests provide more definitive diagnoses of diabetes.

in addition, type 2 diabetes can increase the risk of dvts, so if you are diagnosed with diabetes, you might need to adjust your dvt prevention strategies.

in the meantime, try to reduce consumption of foods and drinks with high sugar content until you can see your doctor.
  
while managing the situation it is also important to stay calm, stress can also increase blood sugar levels."
N174,response_5,"while it's not an immediate emergency, a blood glucose level of 200 mg/dl or higher when fasting indicates diabetes. persistent high blood sugar can lead to serious complications over time, including heart disease, vision loss, kidney disease, and nerve damage. the symptoms you're experiencing –decreased tolerance to glucose and excessive thirst–are common indicators of elevated blood sugar levels. considering your family history and current symptoms, it would be advisable to contact your healthcare provider about these high readings. it could be possible that your medications or general health condition are impacting your blood sugar levels, but only your doctor could say for certain. please consider avoiding any sugary drinks or high carbohydrate foods until you can discuss this with your doctor as this could further increase your blood sugar."
N174,response_6,"if you're consistently getting blood sugar readings within the 200-300 mg/dl range, this is a cause for concern and you should definitely seek medical attention. high blood sugar does not always cause symptoms so it's possible to have high blood sugars for a while without it being noticed. it definitely isn't an emergency that requires you to go to the er right now, but you should contact your primary care doctor as soon as possible to discuss your readings.

these high levels could be due to many reasons including stress, disease, medications, diet, or many other factors. it is possible that the steroids you took recently affected your blood glucose levels. i would also suggest reducing the consumption of carbohydrates such as rice, as this can cause spikes in blood glucose especially in people with predisposition to diabetes.

again, seek professional medical advice as soon as you can. they may arrange a test called a hemoglobin a1c, which would give a good idea of your blood sugar control over the past 3 months. if it's confirmed that you do have consistently high blood sugars, then your physician will work with you to create a plan that could involve diet changes, exercise, and potentially medication to help manage your blood glucose levels.

please note this advice is intended to be general in nature, and specific causes may not apply to your situation. always consult with a healthcare provider for appropriate examination, testing, and care recommendations."
N174,response_7,"these blood sugar levels are high, especially considering your family history of type 2 diabetes. this isn't an immediate emergency, but you should definitely reach out to your healthcare provider as soon as possible to discuss your symptoms and findings. it's not entirely clear why your blood sugar is spiking, it could be related to your diet, weight, stress, lack of sleep, or medication side effects among other possibilities. topical steroids are less likely but in some cases could contribute to increased blood pressure or blood sugar levels.

it would be wise to note your blood sugar readings, dietary intake, and symptoms leading up to these findings to help your doctor make a proper diagnosis. until you're able to see your provider, continue to avoid sugary food and drink, as well as high glycemic index carbohydrates. also try to exercise lightly, such as going for a walk or doing some at-home yoga - but make sure you do activities within your tolerance given your complex regional pain syndrome. 

i would encourage you to seek a telemedicine appointment as soon as possible or go to urgent care if you start feeling worse (feeling very thirsty, frequent urination, feeling very hungry even while eating, fatigue, vision problems). these could be symptoms of high blood sugar or hyperglycemia."
N174,response_8,"a blood sugar level of 245mg/dl is quite high. however, if you are not experiencing symptoms of a diabetic emergency such as confusion, blurred vision, abdominal pain, rapid breathing, sweet-smelling breath, or unconsciousness, it might not be necessary to go to the emergency room.

since you have a family history of diabetes and combined with your current blood sugar levels, it is generally advisable to contact your healthcare provider as soon as possible about these measurements. regular blood sugar levels, both fasting and postprandial (after eating), and hba1c test may be required. this will help to understand if you have consistent high blood sugar levels and hence developing diabetes.

please, let your doctor know immediately if you develop symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis, which includes dry mouth, feeling very thirsty and tired, urinating more often than usual or having a fruity smell in your breath. 

it's also worth noting that conditions like infections, recent application of corticosteroid, or even stress may temporarily cause a spike in blood sugar levels. nonetheless, these current levels are not to be ignored. 

please consult with your healthcare provider as soon as possible."
N174,response_9,"i'm an ai language model and i can't replace a doctor's advice, but i can provide some guidance. high blood sugar levels, such as the ones you've mentioned, could be a potential sign of diabetes given your family history. the cortisone cream is unlikely to have a significant impact on blood sugar levels, but the medrol pack (oral corticosteroids) can elevate blood sugars. however, the effect should have diminished since it has been 3 weeks after finishing the medication. 

you mentioned symptoms like excessive thirst and bloating, which may also be associated with abnormal blood sugar levels. if your blood sugar levels continue to read high, you should seek medical attention, but this isn't typically considered an emergency unless you're experiencing severe symptoms like shortness of breath, confusion, abdominal pain, weakness, or diabetic ketoacidosis (dka); symptoms of dka include extreme thirst, frequent urination, nausea or vomiting, stomach pain, tiredness, breath with a fruity odor, confusion or difficulty focusing. 

the best course of action would be to call your healthcare provider as soon as possible, explain your symptoms and your blood sugar readings, and ask for guidance. they can better assess your risk given your complete medical history and will be able to guide you on whether further testing or an in-person appointment is necessary."
N174,response_10,"your blood sugar levels are certainly higher than the average, but this is not necessarily an emergency. however, given your family history of type 2 diabetes and the fact that you are experiencing symptoms such as excessive thirst and bloating, it is a good idea to get in touch with your healthcare provider to discuss these symptoms and the high blood sugar readings as soon as possible. 

it's also important to know that corticosteroids, like medrol, can increase blood sugar levels. i can't speak like a healthcare professional, but checking with them might be a good idea in order to address any medication-related problems. 

until you can see your healthcare provider, try to maintain a balanced diet low in processed sugars, stay hydrated, and monitor your blood sugar levels. if you start to feel significantly unwell (extreme thirst, frequent urination, unexplained weight loss, fatigue), seek immediate medical attention."
N174,response_11,"this is not an emergency but it does warrant follow-up with your doctor. 

diabetes can sometimes not show any symptoms, and higher blood sugar levels after eating may suggest that you may indeed have it, especially considering your family history. 

the use of corticosteroids, like the medrol pack you mentioned, has also been known to increase blood sugar levels temporarily. this is something your doctor may consider when evaluating your situation.

the best course of action for you would be to take note of your blood sugar levels over the next few days, and make an appointment with your doctor to discuss these readings. they may also order a blood test to check your hba1c levels, which can provide an idea of your average blood sugar control over the past 2-3 months.

in the meantime, ensure that you're following a balanced diet and drinking plenty of water. if your blood sugar levels continue to rise, or if you start developing symptoms such as extreme thirst, frequent urination, unexplained weight loss, or if you feel generally unwell, you should seek immediate medical attention."
N174,response_12,"it's certainly unusual and concerning for your blood sugars to be this high, especially considering your family history of type 2 diabetes. while this might not necessarily constitute an emergency, it's important you get in touch with your doctor, who can help determine if this is an ongoing issue. it could indeed be possible that you have developed type 2 diabetes.

to answer your question about topical steroids: yes, they can lead to elevated blood sugar levels, though this is usually in high doses over extended periods of time. 

overall, it's best you seek professional advice from your healthcare provider, as they know your health history and can provide you with an assessment and management plan suitable for your case. they might request tests to check your blood glucose levels under controlled conditions, and monitor you over time. if necessary, diabetes can be managed with adjustments to your diet, exercise, and possibly medication.

meanwhile, continue to hydrate yourself, eat a balanced diet, and pay attention to any symptoms such as frequent urination, fatigue, weight loss, blurred vision, slow-healing sores, or recurrent infections. if any of these symptoms occur suddenly and severely, seek immediate medical attention."
N174,response_13,"it's a cause for concern, but not necessarily an emergency unless there are severe symptoms like difficulty breathing, chest pain, confusion, or unconsciousness. however, blood sugar levels consistently above 200 mg/dl or a single reading above 300 mg/dl needs to be addressed quickly. since you have a strong family history of type-2 diabetes, this signals that you may be at risk too.

repeated fasting glucose readings of 126 mg/dl or above, or a random (non-fasting) glucose level of 200 mg/dl or above, may warrant a diabetes diagnosis. also, skin issues such as rashes can be associated with high blood sugar levels. excessive thirst is also a hallmark symptom of hyperglycemia (high blood sugar levels).

use of corticosteroids, both oral like medrol and topical like cortisone cream, can indeed raise blood sugar levels, especially in people with a history of diabetes or at risk of diabetes. not everyone will experience such effect, but it's possible and should be monitored when you are on these medications.

please coordinate with your doctor immediately for proper assessment and intervention. they may recommend additional tests such as fasting blood glucose levels or a hemoglobin a1c to better understand your glucose control over a longer period of time. based on the results of those tests, they can provide you with appropriate management instructions."
N174,response_14,"i'm an ai language model developed by openai and can provide some context to your situation. 

a blood glucose level of 226-245 mg/dl is indeed high. normal fasting blood glucose levels are generally between 70-99 mg/dl, and the levels shouldn't go above 140 mg/dl two hours after a meal.

while this is not immediately life threatening, it is concerning, particularly given your family history of type 2 diabetes and the fact that you've mentioned feeling symptoms such as increased thirst and bloating, which can be symptoms of high blood sugar.

medications and steroids, including topical ones, can indeed affect blood glucose levels, but it's generally difficult to predict to what extent without a detailed medical evaluation. 

while not an acute emergency, i strongly recommend you reach out to your healthcare provider as soon as possible. this could be the start of diabetes, but only testing can confirm this. left untreated, consistently high blood glucose levels can lead to serious complications."
N174,response_15,"any blood glucose reading that is consistently above 200 mg/dl is a concern and needs immediate medical attention, especially if you have a family history of diabetes. even if you have no immediate symptoms, elevated blood glucose over a long period can cause damage to various organs. 

corticosteroids, such as the medrol pack you recently took and the ongoing topical cortisone, can increase blood glucose levels too. therefore, it may be contributing to your elevated readings. 

the bloating and increased thirst could be symptoms of high blood sugar. contact your doctor immediately and discuss these symptoms and your high readings. they may want to conduct further tests and see you to discuss treatment options. in the meantime, drink plenty of water to flush out extra glucose through your urine. 

this is not necessarily an emergency situation requiring an er visit, but it is serious enough to contact your doctor immediately. if you start experiencing severe symptoms such as confusion, difficulty breathing, rapid heart rate, or high ketones in urine (if you have a test kit), seek emergency care. 

for the future, maintaining a healthy balanced diet low in sugars and carbohydrates, along with regular exercise can help regulate your blood sugar levels."
N174,response_16,"unfortunately, i cannot provide medical advice over the internet, but i would highly encourage you to consult with your primary care physician or a healthcare professional about these readings. blood sugar levels over 200 mg/dl are generally considered high and could be indicative of diabetes, especially given your family history. it's also important to consider that certain medications and conditions can impact blood sugar levels. 

however, two abnormal readings may not be enough to diagnose diabetes. a healthcare professional will likely want to order a hemoglobin a1c test or other formal diagnostic tests to better assess your overall blood glucose levels over a period of a few months. continued thirst, frequent urination, and unexpected weight loss are common symptoms of high blood sugar or diabetes.

remember, this isn't an immediate life-threatening emergency, but i would recommend that you get in touch with a healthcare professional to discuss your symptoms and readings as soon as possible.

you can also call a nurse hotline or similar service that your health insurer may provide for more immediate advice, but don't delay in seeking a professional evaluation - whether from your regular healthcare provider or at an urgent care clinic if necessary."
N174,response_17,"given your family history of type 2 diabetes, a blood sugar level of 245 is concerning. while this probably doesn't constitute an ""emergency,"" it's definitely not something you want to ignore. you should call your doctor or healthcare provider to tell them about your elevated blood glucose readings. 

your other symptoms of feeling very thirsty and bloated are also possible symptoms of high blood sugar. they will likely want to perform some more specific tests to get a better read on your blood sugar levels over a longer period of time. they may also decide to adjust your medications or recommend dietary changes which can help you regulate your blood sugar. 

it should be noted that the medication prednisone, used in medrol pack, can elevate blood sugar levels. however, as you finished your prescription 3 weeks ago, its effects should have dissipated by now. the cortisone cream effect on blood sugar is controversial. although some studies suggest it can, this is often at larger doses and sight of application large enough to end up systemic.

remember, only a healthcare provider can make a definitive diagnosis of diabetes, but it's always better to be safe than sorry when it comes to your health. it's important to contact your healthcare provider to confirm these readings and understand the next steps you need to take."
N174,response_18,"your blood sugar levels are indeed high, especially since those are not after-meal values. a normal sugar level in a fasting state is somewhere between 70-100 mg/dl, while for a non-fasting state, it's up to around 140 mg/dl.

while this is not an immediate life threatening emergency, it is not something that you should ignore. high blood sugar for prolonged periods can lead to serious complications like heart disease, stroke, kidney damage, vision problems, or nerve damage.

considering your family history of diabetes, you are at higher risk for developing diabetes and should go to see a healthcare provider as soon as possible. they will very likely want to do blood work, likely a hemoglobin a1c test, a test that provides a three month average of your blood sugar levels, in addition to an immediate blood sugar level.

thankfully, type 2 diabetes can be managed by medications, lifestyle changes - including exercise, dietary changes, and maintaining an optimal weight - and regular monitoring of your blood sugar levels.

in the meantime, try to avoid sugary foods and drinks, eat a balanced diet and try to engage in some mild physical activity. 

do not delay seeking medical attention. it's always better to address these issues before they lead to more complicated health issues."
N174,response_19,"you should definitely get medical attention. they symptoms you are describing, along with your family history and current health puts you at high risk for developing diabetes.

normal blood glucose levels are usually between 70-130 mg/dl before meals, and less than 180 mg/dl two hours after starting a meal. a blood sugar of 245 is definitely high, even after a meal. it's important to note that while these individual test results do not necessarily mean you have diabetes, they should be evaluated, as they are not within the normal range.

since you have a family history of type 2 diabetes and have high blood pressure and are overweight - all these put you at increased risk of diabetes.

topical steroids can sometimes raise blood glucose levels, however, it would be unusual for them to elevate your levels so high.

while not necessarily an emergency, this is something that should be handled very promptly. you should reach out to your primary care physician with these results and follow his/her recommended steps.

stay well hydrated until you can get in touch with your healthcare provider. if you experience any symptoms like severe nausea and vomiting, extreme thirst, frequent urination, dry mouth, drowsiness, or confusion, seek emergency medical attention as these could be symptoms of an emergency condition called diabetic ketoacidosis."
N174,response_20,"high blood sugar readings like you are experiencing can be due to a number of factors such as the rice you ate which is a carbohydrate (and can certainly raise blood sugar), medication (both the medrol and cortisone cream can affect blood sugar levels), and given your family history of type 2 diabetes, you may be at a higher risk.

the blood sugar levels you reported are indeed high. normal blood sugar levels are usually within the range of 70-140 mg/dl. a blood sugar level of 200 mg/dl or higher could suggest diabetes.

however, don't panic. this is not an immediate emergency, but it's definitely something that should be addressed soon. it would be advisable for you to contact your healthcare provider as soon as possible for further evaluation. they may want you to have a repeat blood sugar test and/or an a1c test which gives an average of your blood sugar levels over the past 3 months.

also, keep staying hydrated and try to avoid food and drinks high in carbohydrates/sugars until you can get in touch with your healthcare provider.

please be sure to reach out to an emergency department immediately if you start feeling dizzy, confused, have difficulty breathing, or experience any other extreme symptoms."
N174,response_21,"while this isn't necessarily an emergency, you should certainly reach out to your healthcare provider as soon as possible, ideally today or tomorrow. the hunger and thirst are symptoms of high blood glucose, and in general, a blood sugar level consistently above 200 suggests that there may be an issue with your body's insulin production or usage, which may indicate diabetes, especially given your family history.  

topical steroids or the medrol pack (which contains a type of steroid) could potentially affect your blood sugar levels. glucocorticoids, such as the steroids in medrol, can raise blood glucose levels by interfering with insulin activity.

your doctor might want to run some tests to determine what's happening. this could include more frequent blood glucose checks, a hemoglobin a1c test (which gives an average of your blood sugar levels over the past 3 months), and potentially an oral glucose tolerance test.

in the meantime, try to avoid very high-sugar or carb-loaded foods, stay hydrated, and monitor your blood sugar levels. if you begin to feel very unwell, or your blood sugar levels continue to rise, seek immediate medical attention. it's important not to ignore persistently high blood glucose levels, as this can lead to acute complications like diabetic ketoacidosis, which is a medical emergency.

remember this advice doesn't replace a consultation with a healthcare professional. you should reach out to them and discuss your symptoms and concerns."
N174,response_22,"the symptoms you've described (frequent thirst, higher than normal blood sugar readings) could indeed be suggestive of diabetes, given your family history. however, it's important to note that a diagnosis of diabetes cannot be made from a single elevated blood sugar reading. this is usually confirmed by having two separate blood sugars over 200, or a hba1c value of 6.5% or higher (indicating average blood sugar over the past 3 months).

it's also important to note that certain medications, such as steroids like medrol, can increase your blood sugars temporarily. they do this by decreasing insulin sensitivity and increasing glucose production in the liver. topical steroids can also cause increased blood sugars, although this is less likely than systemic steroids.

given these facts, it's not clear whether your current high blood sugars are due to a transient effect of the medrol, or whether they're indicating a new diagnosis of diabetes.

i would recommend reaching out to a healthcare provider about your concerns as soon as possible. while a blood sugar in the 200s isn't an immediate emergency (unless accompanied by symptoms like confusion, difficulty breathing, or loss of consciousness), it is a concerning finding that needs evaluation and possibly treatment. 

again, it's not recommended to self-diagnose diabetes. please reach out to a healthcare provider to discuss your readings and symptoms.

moreover, uncontrolled blood pressure, being overweight, and having diabetes all run together as metabolic syndrome which can importantly increase your risk of heart disease, stroke and other complications. therefore lifestyle modifications are very critical to manage all these conditions effectively. 

so don't panic, but do get checked out as soon as you can."
N174,response_23,"these elevated blood sugar levels may need urgent medical attention. people without diabetes typically have blood sugar levels below 140 even after eating, according to the american diabetes association. a level of 200 or above may suggest diabetes. you might be thirsty and bloated due to high blood sugar levels, which can also lead to frequent urination, blurred vision, increased appetite, fatigue or upset stomach.

certain medications can have an effect on glucose metabolism and cause hyperglycemia. conditions like high blood pressure and obesity can also be the cause.

although this is not a definitive diagnosis, considering your family history of diabetes, these levels might indicate you have developed the condition as well. it's important not to wait and promptly see a healthcare provider who can confirm the diagnosis and start you on treatment if necessary.

please, don't self-treat or ignore these symptoms. contact your primary care provider as soon as possible. if you're experiencing severe symptoms, seek immediate medical attention."
N174,response_24,"while a blood sugar level of 226-245 is quite high and can be concerning, it is usually not considered an immediate emergency. however, it's not normal and you should certainly contact your healthcare provider as soon as possible. your doctor might want to run more tests or adjust your medication. given your family history of type 2 diabetes, weight, and high blood pressure, you could be at an increased risk for developing type 2 diabetes.

regarding your other question, yes, steroids including topical ones, can actually affect your blood sugar levels. steroids can increase your blood sugar levels and in some cases may precipitate diabetes.

there's also the possibility that your elevated blood sugar is due to an error with your glucose monitor or test strips. if this high reading is a new occurrence, it might be worth trying a different monitor, trying new test strips, or having a lab draw done for confirmation.

in general, you should drink plenty of water and avoid high-sugar foods.

feeling extremely thirsty is a common symptom of high blood sugar, but it can also be a symptom of several other conditions and doesn't necessarily mean you have diabetes. other common symptoms of high blood sugar include frequent urination, unexplained weight loss, fatigue, and blurred vision.

again, please contact your healthcare provider soon to discuss these results. you should continue to monitor your blood sugar levels and keep a record of the results to share with your doctor."
N174,response_25,"it's definitely concerning as these are high glucose levels. with your family history of diabetes, it could potentially indicate the onset of diabetes. but it's not necessarily an immediate emergency that requires you go to the er right now.

nevertheless, it's definitely important to address. make sure you stay hydrated by drinking a lot of water. try to avoid carbohydrates and sugar-heavy foods and drinks until you can get this evaluated by a healthcare provider.

you should contact your healthcare provider as soon as you can and let them know about these readings. they'll likely want to do further testing to establish if this is a pattern and how best to manage it. also discuss with them your medication regimen to ensure none of your meds might be causing this. steroids can sometimes increase blood sugar levels, but you've finished medrol pack quite few weeks ago and it shouldn't have been affecting your blood sugar right now.

note, persistent high blood sugar levels over periods can lead to serious complications like kidney damage, eye damage, etc. if you start to have other symptoms like significant fatigue, urinating multiple times a night, losing weight unintentionally, having blurry vision etc., you should seek immediate medical care."
