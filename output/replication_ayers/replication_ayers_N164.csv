N164,response_1,"i'm an ai language model and not a doctor, but i can nonetheless offer some potential explanations for what your wife is experiencing. it's crucial to remember to consult directly with healthcare providers for medical advice. 

urinary retention (difficulty completely emptying the bladder) can be caused by several factors. pregnancy itself sometimes causes changes in urinary habits due to the growing uterus applying pressure on the urinary tract. however, your wife's situation seems more severe. 

given her history of endometriosis, it is possible that the condition might be affecting her urinary tract. endometriosis can sometimes cause scarring or adhesions that can put pressure on the bladder or ureters, leading to symptoms like difficulty urinating. 

a nerve-related issue is another possible cause. certain neurological disorders can interfere with signals between the brain and the bladder, affecting the bladder's ability to contract and release urine.

lastly, certain medications or reactions to medications can also cause urinary retention, though you did not mention any medication she's currently taking.

the immediate relief of symptoms with the catheter suggests an obstructive issue, while the absence of infection and inflammation indicates this is not due to an infection. 

do follow up with the urologist as soon as possible and consider immediate medical attention if she goes back to experiencing intense pain or inability to urinate."
N164,response_2,"i'm an ai language model developed by open ai and capable of providing some generalized advice, but please keep in mind that the specific diagnosis or treatment should be confirmed by a medical professional, preferably a urologist. 

your wife's urinary symptoms sound a lot like urinary retention. this can have various causes. pregnancy itself can contribute to urinary problems. as the uterus grows, it can block the drainage of urine from the bladder, causing symptoms like those your wife is experiencing. this is more common later in pregnancy but can occur at any time.

given your wife's medical history of endometriosis, it's also possible that this is playing a role. endometriosis can cause scar tissue to form, which can sometimes affect the bladder or the nerves that control bladder function.

the lack of infection or increased white blood cell count suggests that this is not due to a urinary tract infection (though a uti can also cause similar symptoms).

the negative covid tests make it less likely that this is due to a covid infection, but not impossible. antigen tests have been known to give false negatives, especially in people without symptoms.

finally, it's also possible that there could be a stone blocking the urinary tract. although you mentioned that your wife feels like she has a kidney stone, the absence of blood in the urine makes this less likely (unless the stone is not currently passing).

removal of the urinary catheter without proper management of the underlying cause can indeed lead back to square one. therefore, the visit to the urologist for more specific diagnosis and management seems quite necessary. call the urologist's office, explain the situation, and request if they can expedite the appointment.

in the meantime, monitor for any signs of infection such as fever, chills or worsening pain. catheters can sometimes introduce bacteria into the bladder, leading to infection. if your wife develops these symptoms, she should seek medical attention immediately."
N164,response_3,"i'm a language ai developed by openai and i can suggest possible reasons for the condition. however, it's still best to speak to a doctor for proper diagnosis.

urinary retention in your wife's case may be due to pregnancy related changes. as the uterus grows, it can put pressure on the bladder, leading to urinary retention. 

another possible cause can be neurological issues. any injury or disorders affecting the nerves that control the urinary system can cause urinary retention.

endometriosis can also cause urinary retention. it can lead to the formation of scar tissue which can block the urinary tract.

medications like certain antihistamines, antispasmodics, or antidepressants can cause urinary retention. 

lastly, weakened bladder muscles or certain acute infections can also cause these symptoms.

it's crucial to discuss all the symptoms in detail with the urologist once your appointment is scheduled.

if the pain is unbearable or if she's unable to pass urine for a long period, it's important to get medical attention right away, despite the inconvenience of possibly going back to square one."
N164,response_4,"i'm an ai, and i'll try to offer some ideas based on my knowledge. if she has endometriosis, this condition can affect organs outside the uterus. endometrial tissues may grow on the bladder or ureters, the tubes that carry urine from the kidneys to the bladder. this endometrial growth can cause inflammation, urinary frequency, painful urination, or urinary retention, which might explain your wife’s symptoms. pregnancy can also put pressure on the bladder increasing the symptoms. urinary retention can also occur due to nerve issues, medications or certain other medical conditions. however, an in-person appointment with a doctor is essential to come to a definite diagnosis.

furthermore, you are correct in that a catheter cannot be a long-term solution, given the risk of uti and other complications. the need to see a urologist is an immediate one. if you’re having difficulty getting a timely appointment, voice your concern about the catheter with your primary care practitioner or ob/gyn, they may be able to leverage their networks or referrals to get an earlier appointment. if this doesn't work, going back to the er might be your best chance to get immediate attention and possibly an admission until there's a solution. don't forget to keep testing for utis as well, as she's vulnerable while catheterised. your wife's case is a complex one that requires a professional's attention."
N164,response_5,"i'm an ai language model developed by openai and i'm not a doctor, but i can provide some general insight into this matter.

urinary retention, the inability to empty the bladder completely, can occur for several reasons. it could be related to nerves controlling the bladder being affected by an infection, a surgery, diabetes or childbirth, muscle problems, or it could be due to a blockage or obstruction in the urinary tract.

given your wife’s history of endometriosis and pregnancy, these factors could potentially be contributing to her condition. endometriosis can cause adhesions (which are fibrous bands) that can put pressure on or obstruct the bladder or ureters and sometimes cause urinary symptoms like the ones your wife is experiencing. furthermore, the physical changes that occur during pregnancy can also cause problems with bladder function.

that being said, it's crucial to get a proper medical diagnosis. please continue working with your physician, the er and waiting for the urologist appointment. each healthcare provider can provide their own expertise in figuring out the root cause of this issue and formulating a treatment plan. you might also want to consult with a gynaecologist given the patient's medical history."
N164,response_6,"while remote advice can't definitively diagnose your wife's condition, her symptoms suggest the possibility of a urinary retention. this occurs when someone cannot empty their bladder completely. it can be caused by a number of factors. in the context of her endometriosis and current pregnancy, both conditions might exert pressure on the bladder and surrounding local nerves, impairing the normal flow of urine.

a large ovarian cyst, which can occur with endometriosis, might also potentially cause urinary retention. 

neurological conditions such as multiple sclerosis, parkinson's disease or stroke, injury to the spinal cord, and certain medications can also result in this condition, though these seem less likely in your wife's case, based on the information you provided. 

finally, it is possible that the retention is related to covid-19, as suggested by her doctor. despite the negative antigen tests, consider follow-up pcr test to fully rule out this possibility. 

it is critically important that your wife consults with her ob/gyn and urologist as soon as possible to determine the exact cause. until then, keeping her comfortable with use of the catheter is vital to avoid further complications caused by an overstretched bladder. keep track of any other symptoms and consult the healthcare providers immediately if there are signs of infection (like fever, chills or malaise) or in case the pain gets worse."
N164,response_7,"during pregnancy, the growing uterus places increased pressure on the lower abdomen and can interfere with the flow of urine. this can lead to symptoms such as difficulty urinating, a weak urinary stream, and feeling the bladder is not fully emptied. 

additionally, your wife's history of endometriosis and unilateral ovariectomy (removal of one ovary) could be contributing factors. endometriosis can cause adhesions or scar tissue to develop, which may affect the bladder or the nerves that control bladder function. 

however, the level of urinary retention your wife is experiencing sounds severe, and is abnormal even for pregnancy. there could be an other underlying issue at play. 

a urologist is definitely the right specialist to consult for a thorough evaluation and diagnosis. while waiting for the appointment, it might be wise to monitor for any changes or worsening symptoms, and if any complication arises, head back to the er immediately. 

regarding the catheter, while it's true that it's not ideal to leave it in for too long due to risk of infection, it will probably be necessary until your wife can see a specialist who may provide an alternative solution.

i would recommend discussing with your physicians if it might be appropriate to keep the catheter for longer, especially if it's helping her significantly and you're very careful about infection control. 

this does all come with the caveat that i'm an ai and not a physician, so it's best to continue talking to your healthcare providers about this. be persistent in requesting help and understanding. 

i hope this helps and that your wife gets appropriate care soon. she's in a tough situation, and you're both in my thoughts."
N164,response_8,"i'm an ai language model and not a doctor, but i can help provide some general information to consider. urinary retention can be caused by a number of factors, including nerve problems, bladder stones, infections, constipation, certain medications, and sometimes pregnancy. in your wife's case, given her history of endometriosis, it is possible that the endometriosis could be contributing to the issue, as this condition can cause scarring or adhesions that could impact the bladder. pregnancy itself could also cause pressure on the bladder leading to difficulty fully emptying it. 

however, only a urologist or other appropriate medical professional can provide an accurate diagnosis, especially since it's clear an infection has been ruled out. if your wife's symptoms worsen, or if she develops other symptoms (like fever, severe pain, blood in the urine, or signs of progressing pregnancy complications) it may be appropriate to seek more immediate attention. 

until you see the urologist, it could be helpful to track urinary symptoms, any changes in pain or discomfort, and any other new symptoms that may arise to help fully portray the situation to the doctor."
N164,response_9,"i'm an ai language model and while i can't diagnose conditions, i can make you aware of conditions that include symptoms you've described. it's possible your wife could be experiencing some form of urinary retention which could be due to a number of causes including a urinary tract obstruction, nerve problems, or medications. also since she's pregnant, the growing uterus can sometimes press on the bladder making it harder to fully empty. previous history of endometriosis could also be linked to difficulties with urination, as the condition can cause adhesions and lesions on and around the bladder. but it's really important for her to see the urologist, they will be able to provide a definite diagnosis and treatment options. make sure she keeps well hydrated and follow all medical instructions from her doctors. monitor any changes in symptoms and let the doctors know about them. 

remember, while waiting for your appointment, if her condition worsens or new symptoms arise, don't hesitate to seek medical help immediately. this could be a sign of an emergency situation such as an acute urinary retention."
N164,response_10,"i'm an ai and while i can provide some general possible conditions based on the information provided, i cannot diagnose or replace a real doctor's advice. your wife's symptoms are indicative of urinary retention, which can be caused by a number of issues, including a neurogenic bladder, certain medications, constipation, or potentially obstruction due to pregnancy or endometriosis. 

the lack of infection and elevated wbc count makes uti less likely, but microhematuria (small amount of blood in urine) could suggest stones (though she's not mentioned other symptoms like flank pain). 

certain procedures or conditions might interfere with nerves that signal bladder control, leading to urinary retention. with her history of endometriosis, it's also possible that the disease could be affecting her urinary tract. 

pregnancy could also be a factor. as the uterus expands, it can press onto the bladder, ureters or urethra, causing symptoms like frequency, nocturia or retention. 

the involvement of a urologist is crucial to get a clear diagnosis and proper treatment in place especially considering ongoing pregnancy. hope she gets an appointment soon. meanwhile, follow the current line of treatment and consider telemedicine consults. if her symptoms become severe or other concerning symptoms appear, do not hesitate to seek immediate medical care."
N164,response_11,"i'm an ai developed by openai and not a doctor, but i can suggest some possibilities based on the information you've provided. retention of urine in a pregnant woman could be due to several reasons:

1. mechanical obstruction: this could be due to a growing uterus or fetal position causing pressure on the bladder or urethra. an enlarged uterus, for example, could physically impede the flow of urine.

2. neurological conditions: occasionally, nerve problems, for instance a neurogenic bladder, could inhibit signalling between the brain and the bladder, leading to difficulty emptying the bladder.

3. medications: certain medications can cause urinary retention.

4. pelvic floor dysfunction: pregnancy can put a lot of stress on the muscles in your pelvic floor, affecting how you control your urine.

5. endometriosis: you've mentioned your wife's history of endometriosis. sometimes, the condition could cause growths that block the urinary tract.

the best course of action is indeed to see a urologist. it's important to get to the root cause, particularly as your wife is pregnant. if she's unable to see a urologist soon and the symptoms persist after the catheter is removed, it may indeed be necessary to return to the er.

as for the connection to covid-19, while we are still understanding this virus, there have been reports of covid-19 patients experiencing urinary symptoms, but these seem to be relatively rare and usually accompany other more common covid symptoms. 

remember though that i am an ai, and this advice is based on a general understanding of the information you provided. please consult a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis."
N164,response_12,"i'm an ai developed by openai, and i'm unable to examine patients or provide a professional diagnosis. however, i may suggest some possibilities for your situation based on the provided information. urinary retention like this can be due to a number of issues, which might include endometriosis (e.g. if adhesions are impacting the bladder), problems related to pregnancy (e.g. pressure from the uterus on the bladder) or neurological issues affecting bladder control. furthermore, kidney stones or other urinary obstructions could also cause these symptoms. also keep in mind other potential causes such as medications or bladder dysfunction. 

it's vital to contact your healthcare provider for advice. if symptoms worsen or if high fever, significant lower abdominal/pelvic pain or blood in the urine develops, it's essential to seek immediate medical care."
N164,response_13,"i'm an ai developed by openai and i can't diagnose medical conditions, but i can share that your wife's symptoms might suggest a urinary retention condition, which can sometimes be caused by various conditions including nerve problems, medications, weak bladder muscles or obstructions in the urinary tract. endometriosis can potentially lead to urinary problems if adhesions or cysts interfere with the function of the bladder.

the doctor may want to verify other possible causes of these symptoms. imaging studies like ct or mri may be helpful in revealing any structural abnormalities. neurological evaluations might also be informative if nerve issues are suspected. visiting a urologist would be a good next step, as they can perform more specialized assessments.

in the meantime, attempting to manage the symptoms is important. the catheter will help to empty the bladder, but it shouldn't be a long-term solution due to risks of infections and other complications. your wife may benefit from doing gentle exercises, staying hydrated but not overdoing it, and avoiding dietary irritants, such as caffeine, alcohol, and spicy foods.

this is a concerning situation and it's important to keep communicating with healthcare professionals about it. please do ensure your wife gets needed medical attention promptly."
N164,response_14,"i'm an ai language model and not a real doctor, however, i can suggest some possibilities for you to discuss with your healthcare provider. it's good to hear that your wife's baby is okay and that she's seeing relief with catheterization. several conditions can lead to urinary retention. for instance, pregnancy by itself can sometimes contribute to urinary retention due to the pressure of the growing uterus on surrounding organs like the bladder.

given your wife's history of endometriosis, it's possible that adhesions or lesions from endometriosis could be affecting her bladder or the nerves that control bladder function. her symptoms may also suggest interstitial cystitis, a condition that causes pain and pressure in the bladder and can sometimes mimic a severe urinary tract infection. 

a less likely cause given the lack of infection noted in the labs could be a urethral stricture, which is a narrowing of the urethra that can lead to difficulty emptying the bladder.

these are speculations based on the information you provided and should not be used to make a definitive diagnosis. it's crucial to discuss these possibilities with a medical professional, who can do the adequate tests and studies to pinpoint the cause of your wife's symptoms.

as for the catheter, while it's true that long-term catheterization can increase the risk of infection, the medical team will weigh the benefits versus risks in your wife's particular situation. she should continue to have her symptoms monitored by her care team until she's able to see the urologist."
N164,response_15,"i'm an ai trained by doctors, so i can't make a diagnosis, but i can share that the cause could be due to physical pressure on the bladder from the growing uterus, hormonal changes causing bladder muscle issues, a blockage in the urinary tract, or issues related to her endometriosis. in some cases, it could also be a non-obstetric issue such as a neurogenic bladder, which is a problem with nerves that control the bladder. it’s hard to say without more information, but it’s very important that your wife sees a urologist and potentially a nephrologist as soon as possible to identify the underlying cause and appropriate treatment – having rare conditions like this during pregnancy needs to be carefully evaluated and monitored by a healthcare professional."
N164,response_16,"i'm an ai language model and while i can provide some general advice regarding this situation, i cannot diagnose conditions or replace the advice of a medical professional. 

your wife's symptoms seem to indicate severe urinary retention. in some rare cases, pregnancy can cause urinary retention due to the enlarging uterus pressing against the bladder. her history with endometriosis may also factor in as it can lead to scarring or adhesions that disturb normal urinary function.

however, given her significant pain and inability to fully empty her bladder, it's critical she see a urologist or a professional in obstetric and gynecological medicine. while you wait for that appointment, it might be helpful to encourage fluid intake (unless advised otherwise by her doctor) and continue with the yoga or other non-strenuous exercises that help. 

in case of another emergency because of unbearable pain or inability to urinate, don't hesitate to return to the er. they can provide treatment to alleviate her symptoms and perhaps expedite a specialist appointment. 

the information about urinary retention being related to covid-19 is new to me, and while it's possible, if she's tested negative twice it's less likely (though not unthinkable if false negatives occurred).

it's important to remember that internet-based advice can only be of limited help and she should consult with her healthcare provider for any medical decisions."
N164,response_17,"i'm an ai model developed by openai and not a doctor, but i can try to provide some general information about what might be occurring.

your wife's urinary retention can be due to several causes. in pregnancy, the growth of the baby can put pressure on the bladder and urinary tract, making it harder for urine to pass through. another cause could be neurogenic bladder, which is bladder dysfunction due to neurological damage. this could be from childbirth, trauma, or certain diseases.

also, endometriosis can potentially cause bladder issues. the growths caused by endometriosis can sometimes block the urinary tract.

kidney stones could also potentially cause urinary retention, but usually this would be accompanied by other symptoms like blood in the urine and flank pain.

given that she was suffering from extreme pain and a sense of fullness without being able to properly empty her bladder, and that her catheterisation provided significant relief, the issue might be more mechanical in nature (i.e., a blockage or pressure).

the absence of infection or white blood cell elevation likely rules out infection causes.

she definitely needs a follow-up with a urologist, so pushing for that appointment should be a priority. they can likely perform further investigation (like a cystoscopy or urodynamic studies) to better determine the cause. 

remember this is just a general direction of possible causes, it is absolutely essential to have a medical expert take a closer look and make a definitive investigation."
N164,response_18,"i'm an artificial intelligence and while i can't diagnose, i can suggest some possibilities based on your wife's symptoms. as her symptoms started 10 days ago and there is no known infection, it's possible that her urinary retention may be due to a combination of factors including hormonal changes related to pregnancy and the physical pressure of the uterus on her bladder, particularly given that she has a history of endometriosis. another possibility is a neurological issue that may not have been previously detected, which could affect the signals between the bladder and the brain.

in some cases, urinary retention can be an early sign of a more serious condition, such as a bladder or kidney stone, tumor, or neurological disorder; however, since an ultrasound was done and nothing significant was found, these are less likely. 

you're doing the right thing by seeking care from a urologist. if she starts to have severe pain or other new symptoms, it would also be important to seek emergency care.

again, these are just possibilities and it's very important that you discuss this with a healthcare provider."
N164,response_19,"i'm an ai language model and not a doctor but i can share some insights based on the information you've provided.

urinary retention in women can be caused by several conditions, including constipation, uti, medications, and neurological disorders. certain surgeries or procedures may also obstruct the flow of urine, leading to urinary retention. in pregnancy, compression of the bladder by the growing uterus can also cause urinary retention. 

however, in your wife's case, one possibility that needs to be explored given her history is whether her endometriosis has caused some physical obstruction leading to urinary retention. sometimes endometriosis can cause adhesions, which are bands of fibrous tissue that can bind organs together and can potentially create obstructions. 

another possibility could be bladder or ureteral endometriosis, which can cause similar symptoms, although it is less common.

ultimately, only a healthcare provider can determine the precise cause. her situation, given her pregnancy, should be considered urgent by healthcare providers, as urinary retention can potentially cause harmful effects, particularly the risk of bladder over-distension and urinary tract infections. hopefully, she can see a urologist promptly to properly assess her situation. you should also keep in close contact with her ob/gyn about her situation in the meantime."
N164,response_20,"your wife's situation sounds quite challenging, and while as an ai i cannot diagnose medical conditions, i can share possible factors that might be contributing to her situation. though urinary retention can occur due to various reasons, it tends to be more common in older men due to prostate enlargement. however, in women, it can be linked to factors such as bladder muscle problems, nerve conditions, or blockages in the urinary tract. the facts that she has a history of endometriosis and is currently 11 weeks pregnant could potentially be relevant. 

endometriosis could potentially cause urinary issues if the scar tissue from the disease has formed on or around the bladder or urinary tract. it can also cause pain during intercourse and may cause issues with fertility. i note that she only has her left ovary – i don’t know if this is due to endometriosis but it is worth considering whether any further associated scar tissue might be impacting her urinary function.

pregnancy itself could be a contributing factor, although at 11 weeks, the pressure of the uterus on bladder is less likely. as pregnancy progresses and the uterus expands, it can place pressure on the bladder, making it harder to fully empty during urination. but usually this is more of a problem in the later stages of pregnancy.

lastly, she might be experiencing a type of urinary retention known as neurogenic bladder. this is a neurological disorder that impedes the signals between the brain and the bladder and can cause a disruption in the normal process of urination. 

however, she needs to be evaluated by a qualified medical practitioner. urinary retention comes with significant risk of bladder and kidney damage. if her appointment with the urologist is far off, it might be worth reaching out to her ob-gyn or primary care doctor to discuss her current symptoms and whether she should continue with the catheter or look into alternative steps."
N164,response_21,"i'm an ai language model and while i can't diagnose medical conditions, i may be able to provide some insight. urinary retention (inability to completely empty the bladder) can be caused by a variety of factors, physical and neurologic obstructions being among them. in this case, potential causes could be the impact of the pregnancy itself on the urinary tract or potential complications from the endometriosis.

pregnant women may often experience changes in urinary habits due to the enlarged uterus pressing on the bladder, but it's less common for this to cause severe urinary retention, especially in early pregnancy. 

endometriosis could also potentially play a role, as it can cause adhesions that may obstruct urinary flow.

it's important to seek additional medical attention, ideally with a specialist such as a urologist or urogynecologist, to better understand what's going on. in the meantime, maintaining the catheter is a potential solution to provide symptom relief, though this is not typically a long-term solution and does carry its own risks.

finally, the physician's suggestion to test for covid-19 is likely to rule out a potential neurologic cause of the symptoms, as covid-19 can affect multiple organs and systems.

follow up with the professionals for more in-depth examinations and discussions about potential imaging studies to visualize the urinary tract and surrounding structures. be sure to share all of your wife's relevant medical history and any changes to her symptoms."
N164,response_22,"i'm an ai language model trained by openai and not a doctor. however, i can help provide some possible explanations for your wife's condition. in addition to uti, urinary retention in pregnant women could be due to a number of different reasons such as acute urinary retention, functional failure, obstructive uropathy (urethral stricture, bladder or urethral stone), and nervous system disorders. 

the most frequent case in pregnant women is due to the growing uterus pressing down on the bladder, making it difficult to fully empty it. however, other underlying conditions like a previously present bladder pathology or endometriosis may be implicated. endometriosis can sometimes affect bladder function, especially if the endometrial tissue is impacting the nerves that control the bladder or if there are adhesions from previous surgeries. 

it may also be worthwhile to consider whether any medications your wife is taking may be contributing to the urinary problems, as anticholinergic medicines can sometimes cause urinary retention.

still, the best advice i can provide is to follow up with the urologist as soon as possible to get an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan. if an emergency arises prior to the appointment with the urologist, please seek urgent medical care.

in any case, these should be viewed as possibilities only and not definitive explanations. only a healthcare professional can diagnose your wife's condition."
N164,response_23,"it sounds like your wife is experiencing urinary retention, the cause of which can be complex and multi-factorial. in some instances, endometriosis could be causing this, as it can cause scarring and adhesions that could potentially affect the normal function of the bladder. pregnancy can also sometimes affect bladder function, especially as the uterus enlarges and starts to press on the bladder.

however, it is also worth exploring other potential causes such as neurologic issues, bladder stones, or even structural abnormalities of the urinary tract. the latter could include a prolapsed bladder or urethral stricture, although these are usually less likely given your wife's age and reproductive history.

the next important step is for your wife to see a urologist. she might need to undergo further tests, like a urodynamics study which can evaluate how the bladder and urethra are storing and releasing urine. moreover, she might need some imaging studies (like a ct scan or mri), which could help to identify potential causes that are not infection-related.

this is a condition which needs proper medical attention, please consult with a doctor as soon as possible. this information provided should not be a substitute for professional medical advice."
N164,response_24,"i'm an ai developed by openai, and while i can't diagnose illnesses, i can certainly clarify some possibilities that may be occurring and provide some insight into this condition.

the most straightforward explanation for these symptoms would be acute urinary retention (aur), which can sometimes affect pregnant women due to the enlarged uterus pressing on the bladder. however, this usually happens later in pregnancy, and is less likely to be the case here since your wife is still in her first trimester.

endometriosis could also possibly be playing a role. endometriosis is a condition where tissue similar to the lining of the womb grows in other places, like the ovaries or fallopian tubes. this can sometimes cause scarring or blockages in the urinary tract, which might result in difficulty in urinating, but it's unclear if there is a direct cause-and-effect relationship here.

it's also worth noting that neurological conditions (like multiple sclerosis), bladder stones, a cystocele, or a urethral stricture can cause the symptoms you describe. however, these are less likely given her age and circumstances.

the low white blood cell count and lack of infection in the labs do make things a bit more confusing, as they suggest that an infection is not the underlying cause.

make sure to keep monitoring her symptoms and seek immediate medical attention if they worsen. it's important to get to the bottom of this, as untreated urinary retention can potentially lead to serious complications, like bladder damage or kidney damage. 

please note that only a healthcare professional can give you a definitive diagnosis, so please continue seeking medical help until her symptoms are resolved and a clear diagnosis is made. also, consider contacting the hospital or health system where you received care, as they may have resources available to that could facilitate a more prompt urology appointment."
N164,response_25,"urinary retention resulting in an inability to pass urine can be caused by a number of conditions. it is important to get to the root of the problem to understand what is causing it in order to treat it effectively. some possibilities given the information you've provided might include:

1. pregnancy-related changes: during pregnancy, the growing uterus can press on the bladder resulting in sensations of bladder fullness, frequent urination or difficulty emptying the bladder.

2. endometriosis: this is a condition where the tissue that lines your uterus grows outside of the uterus, including on the bladder. this could lead to bladder dysfunction and urinary retention.

3. pelvic organ prolapse: this is a condition where the muscles and tissues supporting the pelvic organs (uterus, bladder, or rectum) become weak or loose. when this happens, one or more of the pelvic organs may drop or press into or out of the vagina.

4. neurological problems: certain neurological conditions can affect the nerves involved in bladder function leading to problems like urinary retention.

the definitive diagnosis would however depend on a complete evaluation by a urologist. in absence of infection, urodynamic studies could help figure out exact cause of increased residual urine in your wife. moreover, please consider an expedited appointment with a urologist given the severity of the symptoms. 

a 'can't wait' or 'urgent' appointment with a specialist could be arranged considering the severity of symptoms and its potential impact on health of your wife and the unborn child.

in meantime, please continue following the recommendations of the emergency room doctors and the primary care provider.
  
keep in mind this advice is intended to be general in nature, and specific causes may not apply to your wife's individual situation. always consult with a healthcare provider for accurate information."
