N13,response_1,"firstly, i just want to say that it's incredibly brave of you to seek help even with everything you've been through. the good news is that it is never too late to start caring for your teeth.

here are a few steps to guide you:

1. look for a public dental service: australia has public dental services that provide free or reduced-fee treatment for eligible people. you can find out your eligibility through your state or territory health department.

2. schedule a check-up: when you first go to a dentist, you will typically have a consultation and a check-up. this involves them asking about your medical and dental history, followed by a full examination of your mouth, teeth, and gums.

3. discuss your dental issues: be honest and upfront about any oral health problems you've encountered and the history of neglect. a good dentist will not judge you for this but will help you find the right treatment.

4. plan your treatment: depending upon the condition of your teeth, the dentist will suggest a treatment plan. this may include cleanings, fillings, extractions, or other procedures. some of these treatments might be costly, especially if you need cosmetic dentistry. 

5. understand the costs: before agreeing to any treatment, ask for a full breakdown of the costs. most dental clinics will be able to give you an estimate of the costs before the treatment begins.

6. dental schools: dental schools offer reduced costs because their students provide the treatment as part of their training (under the supervision of experienced professionals). it can be a good option if your budget is tight.

7. payment plans: many dentists offer payment plans, so ask about this option. keep in mind that you should have a clear understanding of what is included in the plan and how much it will cost in total.

8. look after your oral hygiene: adopt healthy dental habits moving forward. brush twice a day, floss daily, and use mouthwash to maintain oral health. 

remember, it's perfectly okay to feel unsure and afraid. most people aren't exactly thrilled about going to the dentist, but regular dental care is very important for your overall health. and don't be too hard on yourself. what matters now is that you're taking steps to improve your dental health."
N13,response_2,"i'm sorry to hear about your situation. here are some steps that you may want to consider:

1. find a dental clinic: the first step is to find a dental clinic suitable for your needs. this may involve doing a quick google search for ""affordable dental care near me"" or ""low-cost dental clinics in australia"". public dental services in australia are funded by the government and may require a co-payment but are generally more affordable than private clinics. 

2. consultation:  most dental appointments begin with a check-up, during which the dentist evaluates your teeth, gums, and mouth, and recommends if any treatment is required. feel free to discuss your financial concerns with your dentist as well, they may be able to break up necessary treatment over a few stages to make it more affordable. dentists generally display a basic price list but the final cost can vary depending on the complexity of the situation.

3. dental schools: another option is to consider seeking treatment at a dental school clinic. prices at these clinics are typically much lower than at regular dental offices. dental students will be able to perform cleanings, fillings, and other procedures under the direct supervision of their instructors.

4. payment plans: some dentists offer payment plans, which allow you to spread out payments over a series of months or even years. if this is something that could benefit you, don't hesitate to ask about this possibility when you call or visit a dental office.

5. charities/ nonprofits help: many charity organizations and outreach programs provide free or low-cost dental care to those in need. a little research online can provide a list of such organizations operating in australia.

6. prevention: the best way to keep dental costs low is through prevention. brushing and flossing daily, along with regular cleanings and check-ups, can help prevent more serious and expensive dental problems down the line. 

so, in conclusion, remember to clearly communicate your needs and concern to the dentist beforehand. every dental practice operates a little differently, but the common factor is that they all want to help you achieve a healthy mouth and smile. good luck!"
N13,response_3,"i'm sorry to hear you're experiencing these difficulties but here are a few suggestions for getting affordable dental care in australia:

1. public dental services: in australia, both children and adults with health care cards or pensioner concession cards may be eligible for public dentistry through the public dental system. however, due to high demand, there may be waiting lists depending on the severity of your condition. contact your state's health department to find out more.

2. dental schools: dental schools often need patients on which their students can practice their skills. the treatment here would be heavily supervised by a professional, and charges are usually significantly less. some universities with dental schools in australia are the university of melbourne, the university of sydney, and the university of queensland.

3. community health centres: many community health centers offer dental care at a reduced fee. you can search for community health centers or dental clinics in your area and then contact them to find out what services they offer and at what cost.

as for what to expect when visiting a dentist:

- first, you make an appointment. you don't necessarily need to know everything you want to be done beforehand, although if you have a specific concern you'd certainly mention that.
- during your appointment, the dentist will examine your teeth and possibly take x-rays.
- then they will discuss with you what they've found and what treatment(s) they recommend.
- you should ask questions about the cost of the treatment, how necessary it is, if there are any alternatives, and payment plans.

finally, don't be embarrassed about your teeth. dentists are professionals who are there to help you, not to judge you. if you're unsure about anything, don't hesitate to ask them for guidance."
N13,response_4,"i'm really sorry to hear about your situation, and it's completely understandable that the prospect of arranging dental care can be daunting. here are a few things you could consider:

1. **medicare:** in australia, medicare may cover some dental treatments but it's mainly for people who meet specific requirements like being a child in family assistance programs or having a chronic medical condition. however, please check your eligibility as there might be a program you qualify for.

2. **public dental services:** each state in australia offers public dental services, many of them at a reduced cost or free for low-income earners. wait times can be long for non-emergency care however.

    for example:
    - in victoria, there’s the dental health services victoria. 
    - in nsw, there’s the nsw health.
   
   these services have clinics all over the state, so there might be one near you. do a google search to find your local public health department. 

3. **community health centres:** check if there's a community health centre near you. they often offer dental services on a sliding scale, which means they charge based on your income.

4. **dental schools:** there are several dental schools in australia where you can get dental work done by students under supervision. this is often much cheaper than regular care. universities such as the university of melbourne, the university of sydney, and the university of queensland all have dental programs.

5. **free dental days or clinics:** some private dentists hold free dental care days, where you might be able to get some work done for free.


in terms of the process of going to the dentist, it normally involves:

- **booking an appointment:** you usually start by calling the dentist’s office and scheduling an appointment. they will ask for your details and brief information about the reason for your visit. you don't necessarily have to know what treatment you need; that's what the dentist is there to determine.
- **initial consultation:** the dentist will perform a thorough checkup, which usually involves taking x-rays. they will then be able to give you a diagnosis, explain what treatment is necessary, and give you a quote for that treatment.
- **getting the treatment:** if you agree to the treatment and the cost, the dentist will then schedule you for future appointments to have the work done. 

always be sure to ask about costs upfront, and don't be shy about discussing your financial situation and any concerns you have"
N13,response_5,"i'm sorry to hear about your circumstances. your first line of action should be reaching out to the australian dental association (ada) or similar body in your state. they should be able to provide you with information about any reduced-cost dental clinics in your area and/or financial assistance programs that can help cover the cost of your treatment. 

as for appointments, here's a general idea of what to expect during a dental visit:

1. make an appointment: you might want to call up a few different dental practices and ask about pricing and payment options, specifically for people who are in a tough financial situation. some clinics may offer a sliding scale based on income.

2. dental check: once you arrive for your appointment, you will most likely start with an examination. the dentist will look at your teeth, gums, and mouth to assess health and detect any issues. they may also take x-rays to see things that are not immediately visible, like hidden cavities or wisdom teeth.

3. discussion: after the examination, the dentist will discuss the state of your oral health with you. they will lay out a treatment plan if any problems are detected. this is when you should talk about your financial situation and discuss possible options for care. most dentists are understanding and may be able to suggest options that are not as expensive.

4. treatment: treatments could range from simple teeth cleaning to more complex dental procedures. it'll depend on the current state of your oral health. payments for these procedures vary. 

5. follow-ups: depending upon the treatment, you may need follow up visits or continuous treatments. again, discuss this with your dentist and see if there are ways to minimize the costs or spread them over the long term.

remember to ask for a cost estimate of any treatment before it's undertaken. you're entirely within your right to ask about costs before agreeing to a procedure. you may also want to ask your dentist about basic dental hygiene and any specific care you need to follow at home.

this might seem overwhelming, but remember that it's okay to ask for help and take things step by-step. try not to feel embarrassed - dentists are professionals and there to help, no matter what your teeth look like. 

i hope this helps a bit and wish you all the best as you navigate this process!"

when you meet with the dentist, be upfront about your financial situation and your concerns. they should be able to provide a cost estimate for any work you need done and may even be able to prioritize the most important treatments. 

remember that taking charge of your own dental care is a big step forward! no matter what, keep up your regular brushing and flossing – even these small actions can make a big difference."

it's important that you inform the dentist up front about your financial constraints. this way, they can prioritize treatments to address the most severe or urgent issues first while helping you stay within budget.

as for governmental assistance, australian citizens and permanent residents can get help through public dental services provided by each state or territory, though it may involve waiting periods. the child dental benefits schedule (cdbs) provides access to benefits for dental services to about 3 million children aged 2-17.

adults with low income might also be eligible for public dental services, though they could also face waiting periods. some states/territories also have dental vouchers or subsidies given through public dental services.

it might be worth looking into taking out insurance for dental care, especially if you anticipate needing extensive treatment. many health insurance providers in australia offer coverage for dental care.

lastly, your mental health is important too. if you're feeling overwhelmed, consider reaching out to a mental health professional. there are many organizations and helplines in australia that offer free or low-cost mental health services.+"
N13,response_11,"i'm so sorry to hear about your situation but it's never too late to start caring for your teeth. here's an outline of what the dental process is like and some options in australia that may be of help to you.

4. after the assessment, the dentist will devise a treatment plan. this refers to any procedures that you might need to fix any issues. 

5. the clinic will give you a quote or estimate for the proposed treatment plan.

to keep costs down, ask for a quote before you agree to the proposed treatment and don't be afraid to get a second opinion if you're unsure. also, let your dentist know about your financial restrictions up front, as they may be able to suggest more budget-friendly treatment options or payment plans. 

it's important to remember good everyday practices (brushing twice a day, flossing) can help maintain the work done by the dentist and minimize future costs. it's not the easiest journey, but every small improvement you make will be a step towards better oral health. good luck!"

1. **public dental service**: if you are an australian citizen, you are eligible for public healthcare which does cover dental services. however, there can be long wait times for these services. you will likely need to register with your local health district and they can give you more details. 

2. **dental schools**: dental schools often offer services at discounted rates. students perform the work, but they are supervised by experienced professionals so you can be sure you're getting good care.

3. **call around**: not all dentists charge the same rates, so you could save money by calling around and pricing out the services you need. 

4. **payment plans**: some dentists will allow you to spread out the payments over time to make it more manageable. ask about their policies when you call.

5. **centerlink**: if you are on centrelink, you may be eligible for the child dental benefits schedule (cdbs) or the adult public dental services. both help make dental care more affordable for those on government assistance.

as for how much dental care costs, it varies greatly depending on what you need done. a consultation with a dentist should give you a better idea of what needs to be done and what it may cost. for those under 18, under centrelink, or in possession of a healthcare card, it may even be free.

4. **dental schools**: in some areas, dental schools may provide free or low-cost dental care as part of their training program for students. it is certainly worth checking out any dental schools near you.

5. **payment plan/ dental memberships**: some private dental clinics offer payment plans or membership schemes where you can pay for your treatment in instalments. this could be an option, and most of the clinics are very patient with this due to the high cost of dental procedures.

as for the procedure, usually, your first appointment will consist of x-rays, an overall check-up, a consultation and cleaning. if you have any specific issues, such as your decaying tooth, a plan will be made for future appointments to address these issues. you should definitely discuss your worries about costs with the dentist, they will be able to guide you and may offer a treatment plan that fits your budget.

the first step you should take is going to a general dentist for a check-up and oral health assessment. they will evaluate your overall dental health, identify any areas of concern and suggest a treatment plan. the dentist should provide you with a quote for the recommended treatment steps, and this will help you know what costs to expect.

the prices can vary depending on the location and individual practice. the australian government provides several grants and funding to support dental health services, and there are also not-for-profit organisations that offer low-cost or free dental service to eligible adults. 

public dental services for adults in australia are generally low cost but may have long waiting times; however, they can arrange emergency appointments for urgent problems. 

you might also want to consider dental schools where dental students, under the supervision of experienced dentists, provide treatment at lower cost. the university of melbourne school of dental science or the university of adelaide dental school are examples of such facilities.

on specific days, some organisations such as the salvation army and red cross offer free dental clinics. you could keep an eye on those as well.

regarding payment plans, there are providers like zipmoney, afterpay and mysmileplan offering interest-free payment plans for dental treatment. also, private health insurance is another option, but you should weigh the costs and benefits carefully before pursuing this route.

remember, regular brushing, flossing and a balanced diet can also help maintain oral health in the long run.

N13,response_15,"first, i'm really sorry to hear about your situation. it must be a challenging time for you but rest assured that help is available.

to start, here is a basic rundown of what to expect when you visit a dentist:

1. when you first call to make an appointment, you can discuss your concerns or what you want to address with the receptionist. in your case, explain about your decaying tooth and mention your financial situation so they have an idea about your needs.

2. during the appointment, the dentist will likely start with a general check-up of your teeth, during which they will probably take some x-rays to get a better idea of what's happening beneath the surface. they'll then discuss your dental health with you and recommend treatments.

3. ask your dentist to provide a cost estimate for any proposed treatments so there won't be any surprising or unexpected bills. it's also completely alright to ask for alternatives, or cheaper treatments.

4. if you're comfortable with your dentist's advice and cost estimate, you can then decide to proceed with the treatment. 

in australia, you have a few resources to help you financially: 

1. public dental services: in all states and territories in australia, the public dental system provides treatment to eligible people. the criteria varies between each state and territory, so you'll need to check your eligibility with your local health department.

2. non-government organisations: some ngos, like the australian dental health foundation, have volunteer dentists who provide free or low-cost treatment to people in financial hardship and can't access public dental care.

3. dental schools: many australian universities have dental schools that offer treatment from supervised dental students at a low cost or free of charge.

remember, it's crucially important to establish a good oral hygiene routine to prevent more serious dental problems in the future. brush at least twice a day, floss every day, and try to eat a balanced diet. 

take care, and don't hesitate to ask anymore questions if you have any."
N13,response_16,"i'm sorry to hear about your situation. it's great that you're taking the initiative and looking for ways to care for your dental health even though you're dealing with financial difficulties. 

in general, the process of visiting a dentist typically involves the following steps: 

1. appointment booking: you'd first call a dental clinic to book an appointment. at this stage, it would be good to mention that you're a new patient and haven't been to a dentist in a while.

2. first visit/check-up: the dentist will check your teeth and gums and possibly take some x-rays. this is to assess the overall condition of your teeth and identify any issues. if you have any specific concerns (like your decaying tooth, or the gap left by a missing tooth), make sure to discuss them with your dentist. they will then suggest appropriate treatment options. 

3. treatment plan: your dentist will come up with a treatment plan, which gives you detailed information on which procedures you need, the cost of each procedure, and how many dental appointments you need.

as for your financial concerns, here are a few options: 

public dental services: australian states/territories offer public dental services, though they usually have long waiting lists. however, if you are eligible (usually if you have a pension or health care card), this could help offset the costs. 

dental schools: some dental schools offer free or discounted dental services. they are performed by students under the supervision of experienced dentists, so you're still getting proper care. 

payment plans: many dental clinics understand that not everyone can afford to pay upfront, especially for expensive procedures. ask if they offer payment plans that allow you to pay in installments. 

lastly, it's essential to ask the dentist or receptionist about costs when you book your appointment. they should be able to give you a general outline of costs for a standard check-up and x-rays. any additional costs (fillings, extractions etc.) they will discuss after the check-up when they know what work you need. 

remember to take good care of your teeth in-between visits to the dentist. brushing twice a day and flossing at least once a day can help maintain your oral health. 

please understand that there is no shame in asking questions and being frank about your situation with your healthcare provider. they're there to help you. best of luck!"

5. **dental insurance**: consider if a dental insurance policy is right for you. some health insurance policies include dental cover, or you can add it for an extra cost. you might fall under the commonwealth department of veteran's affairs, if you're eligible, they offer free dental care.

6. **bulk billing dentists**: these are private dentists who accept medicare benefits as full payment for services, meaning that you don't have to pay anything out of your pocket. to be eligible for this service, you need to receive family tax benefit part a or certain other government payments.
