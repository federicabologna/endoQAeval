N132,response_1,"secondhand vapor or smoke from e-cigarettes also exposes non-users to the nicotine and other harmful chemicals that are present in the aerosol produced by these products. studies have shown that inhaling secondhand vape can lead to nicotine exposure similar to that of secondhand smoke from traditional cigarettes. however, it is still not known if this similar level of exposure could impact surgical outcomes in non-smokers.

nicotine has a half-life of about 1 to 2 hours, meaning that for every hour that goes by, half of the nicotine in your system is processed and eliminated. thus, it takes about 5-7 half-lives for a drug to be almost completely eliminated from your system. however, each person’s metabolism is different so this is just an estimate.

if you're concerned about the potential effects of secondhand vape exposure on your upcoming procedure, it would be a good idea to discuss this with your doctor. they may recommend avoiding exposure to secondhand vape in the weeks leading up to your surgery, as the precise impact of secondhand vape on surgical outcomes is not yet fully understood."
N132,response_2,"secondhand nicotine exposure can indeed affect your body, but it is typically less impactful than if you were the daily smoker. however, inhaling vape smoke for extended periods increases exposure to nicotine and other harmful chemicals, increasing your risk for health issues, including heart disease and respiratory issues. 

nicotine can have multiple effects on your body such as constricting blood vessels leading to decreased blood flow, increased blood pressure and heart rate, increased risk of blood clots, possible delayed wound healing, and interference with the function of red blood cells that carry oxygen to the body. 

that being said, based on your information, it is unlikely to significantly impact your surgery as long as your overall health is good. nicotine has a relatively short half-life of 2 hours, so it generally leaves the body relatively quickly. however, other toxins may remain in your body for longer depending on the concentration and duration of exposure. 

you may want to consider asking your spouse not to vape in the same room or at the very least to decrease the frequency of vaping. 

lastly, you should discuss this with your surgeon or anaesthesiologist prior to your surgery. they may have specific protocols in dealing with patients exposed to secondhand smoke."
N132,response_3,"secondhand vape aerosol is not completely harmless, as it can contain nicotine and other potentially harmful chemicals. however, it is unknown how much of an effect this would have on your upcoming surgery and healing process. it would be best to discuss this with your doctor who will determine if this is a potential concern.

nicotine can constrict blood vessels, which could interfere with healing after surgery. thus, it would be better if you can avoid exposure to the aerosol from your husband's vape as much as possible, especially considering your upcoming surgery.

if possible, your husband should avoid vaping in the same room as you, at the very least. if he can further reduce or eliminate his vaping, particularly in the weeks leading up to your surgery, it would be even better.

regarding the time it would take for nicotine to clear your system, it varies depending on the amount and length of exposure. generally, nicotine may stay in the body for up to a few days. but, as mentioned earlier, it is best to discuss this with your doctor."
N132,response_4,"secondhand vape smoke could potentially expose you to nicotine, but the amount is usually much lower than firsthand smoking. however, any exposure to nicotine can have effects on the body, including constriction of blood vessels and increased heart rate, both of which could complicate surgery and impede healing.

if you're concerned about your upcoming surgery, there are steps you can take to reduce your exposure to secondhand vape smoke. asking your spouse to vape outside, or in a room with good ventilation away from you, could help minimize your exposure. 

nicotine has a half-life of about two hours, meaning it is largely cleared from the body within a day or so. however, the effects on blood vessels and the cardiovascular system can last longer, and it's not entirely clear how long the effects of secondhand vape smoke may persist.

it's always a good idea to speak with your surgeon or the anesthesiologist ahead of the surgery about your concerns. they can provide guidance based on your health history and the specifics of your procedure."
N132,response_5,"there are multiple studies that indicate passive exposure (secondhand smoke or vape exposure) can indeed lead to the presence of nicotine and its metabolites in non-smokers. however, since you are not actively smoking, the levels are typically much lower than those found in active smokers. negative effects of nicotine on wound healing are more associated with active, chronic smoking where the levels of nicotine and other harmful substances are much higher.

that said, it is still a good idea to reduce your exposure to secondhand smoke/vape. this is because secondhand smoke contains numerous harmful substances, including carcinogens (cancer-causing substances). therefore, take steps to limit your exposure, such as asking your spouse to vape outside or in a well-ventilated area, separate from you.

regarding the clearance of nicotine from the body, in active smokers, the half-life of nicotine is approximately 2 hours. this means that roughly half of the nicotine in the body is eliminated every 2 hours. it usually takes about 5 half-lives for a drug to be cleared from the body, so theoretically, nicotine should be cleared from the body within about 10-11 hours after the last exposure. however, this can be longer if exposure is chronic or prolonged, and it also depends on the individual's metabolism. for passive smokers, the elimination time can be longer.

please discuss with your surgeon or anesthesiologist about your situation. they can provide advice tailored specifically to your situation and the specific surgical procedure you are having done.

note: this advice is intended to be general in nature, and specific causes may not apply to your situation. always consult with a healthcare provider for accurate information."
N132,response_6,"secondhand smoke, from traditional cigarettes or e-cigarettes (vaping), can certainly be harmful to your health. specifically, nicotine in the secondhand smoke can narrow your blood vessels and decrease the amount of oxygen that flows to your tissues, which could potentially affect healing after surgery. 

however, the levels of nicotine you would absorb from secondhand smoke, especially that of e-cigarettes, would likely be significantly less than those of an active smoker. so, the risk of surgical complications should be lower.

if you're concerned, it's good practice for your husband to refrain from vaping around you, especially leading up to your surgery, to minimalize your exposure. nicotine generally takes about 48-72 hours to be metabolized and clear out of your body.

as always, i’d recommend discussing these concerns with your doctor or pre-operative medical team. they may have some additional recommendations or precautions for you to take."
N132,response_7,"studies have shown that exposure to secondhand smoke can potentially pose risks. however, they are mostly focused on traditional cigarette smoke, not on vape aerosol. the amount of nicotine in secondhand vape aerosol is smaller than in secondhand tobacco smoke, but it still may pose some risks.

nicotine can affect wound healing by constricting the blood vessels, which can potentially reduce the blood flow to the surgical site and slow recovery.

if you are concerned about possible exposure and its impact on your upcoming surgery, it would be best to discuss this with your surgeon or anesthesiologist. they can give you accurate advice based on your specific circumstances.

also, you should ask your spouse to avoid vaping around you, especially in enclosed spaces. nicotine exposure can be minimized by vaping outdoors or in another room.

lastly, it's important to note that the body metabolizes nicotine over the course of several hours to a few days. it can be detected in the blood for 1-3 days after the last exposure. however, the exact clearance time may vary depending on the frequency and intensity of the exposure and your own metabolism."
N132,response_8,"drinking and eating habits, along with your body’s metabolism, affect how fast nicotine clears from your body. normally, it takes about 3-4 days for nicotine to fully leave your system. however, there is likely to be less nicotine being excreted through the vape than through traditional tobacco smoking. research indicates that passive exposure to vapor from electronic cigarettes may deliver a lesser amount of nicotine than passive exposure to tobacco smoke. thus, the chance of it having a significant effect on your surgery or healing is probably low. that said, it is important to mention your exposure to secondhand vape smoke to your doctor or anesthesiologist before the surgery. they may decide to run tests to determine your level of exposure, as the chemicals in the vape may potentially have effects on your health, particularly since the safety of secondhand vape smoke is not yet fully known."
N132,response_9,"the nicotine content from second-hand vaping is much lower than that from active smoking, but it is still present and carrying risks, including for surgical outcomes. these risks are related more with the chronic exposure to nicotine (and other substances in the smoking/vaping) that leads to permanent changes in the function of the cardiovascular and respiratory systems, smoking/nicotine in itself can alter the platelet function (increasing the risk for blood clots), can impair the healing of tissues and it is also related with other risks following anesthesia.

however, as you can imagine, it is very difficult to estimate the level of nicotine that you're receiving from second-hand smoke/vapor, as it depends on a lot of factors - type of vape, the exact position of the vape with respect to you, the size of the room, how long you stay indoors afterwards, the use of artificial or natural ventilation etc.

the best thing would be for your spouse not to vape in your vicinity and especially indoors/at home. however, in terms of the surgical procedure mid-november, i don't think the nicotine content from second-hand inhalation should be high enough to give you another risk that you don't already have, but it would be a good idea to tell your surgeon and the anesthetics team about it, so they can take adequate precautions. 

after stopping exposure to second hand smoking/vaping, it takes about 2-4 days for nicotine and its metabolites to leave the body. however, the effects on health are longer term and not completely reversible, hence why it's better to avoid second-hand smoking/vaping as much as possible in the long term too."
N132,response_10,"while secondhand smoke from a traditional cigarette is known to be harmful, there is less data regarding the potential harm of secondhand smoke from vaping. some studies suggest that secondhand exposure to vaping can increase levels of nicotine and particulate matter in the air, which could potentially have harmful effects.

nicotine can have effects on the cardiovascular system and can impede wound healing. however, if you're not a smoker or vaper yourself, the secondary exposure you get from your husband's vaping is likely to be much less than what a primary user would get. generally speaking, it's always a good idea to minimize exposure to nicotine and other potential toxins, especially in the weeks leading up to a surgery. 

if your husband could use his vape in another room, or even better outside, this could be particularly beneficial. this approach would be even more effective if he could do it for at least 2-4 weeks before your surgery as it would allow time for any nicotine or other potential toxins to leave your system. 

please discuss this with your surgeon or anesthesiologist to get their opinion as they would have a more comprehensive understanding of your medical history and the specifics of the upcoming procedure."
N132,response_11,"secondhand smoke exposure does not carry the same risks as smoking oneself. for smokers, it's recommended to stop 4-8 weeks prior to surgery as nicotine can constrict the blood vessels and affect the tissues' ability to recover post-surgery. 

however, it's important to note that secondhand smoke/vapor does not impact the body in the exact same way as active smoking. nicotine is not considered to be a high risk from secondhand smoke exposure. the majority of the risks associated with secondhand smoke stem from long-term exposure and include risks such as heart disease.

that being said, your exposure to secondhand vapor is low risk in terms of your upcoming surgery, and it wouldn't require any special preparations. but again, if there are any concerns, you should discuss it with your anesthesiologist or surgeon. they will be the best to guide you on this. 

if your spouse is smoking in the same room as you, it would be better for your overall health and comfort to have them smoke outside or in a well-ventilated area away from you to reduce your exposure to secondhand smoke/vapor as much as possible. 

remember to consult with your healthcare provider for personalized advice."
N132,response_12,"secondhand smoke exposure is not usually considered problematic from an anesthesia perspective because the concentrations of nicotine are not typically high enough to cause issues. however, it is generally recommended to avoid secondhand smoke as much as possible prior to surgery to minimize any potential health risks. 

while prolonged secondhand smoke exposure can lead to significant health issues, including heart disease and lung cancer, these risks develop over years of exposure and do not have direct impacts on anesthesia or surgical procedures. the main concerns with smoking and surgery are generally related to the smoker themselves - smokers are more likely to have breathing complications with anesthesia, slower wound healing, and increased risk of blood clots.

in regard to clearing your system of secondhand smoke, it can vary depending on the exposure levels and individual metabolism. for a non-smoker, any trace amounts of nicotine from secondhand smoke will typically clear their system in a few days. it's also worth mentioning it to your healthcare providers so they are aware, and they can provide you with the most appropriate recommendation for you.

however, it would be ideal if your spouse could smoke in a different room or outside, or refrain from vaping in the same room as you, especially in the period leading up to your surgery."
N132,response_13,"secondhand smoke/vapor can certainly expose you to nicotine and other chemicals. however, it would be quite difficult to say how exactly this would affect your upcoming surgery or the healing process. it's typically direct use of nicotine and smoking that is a major concern prior to surgery due to the impact on cardiovascular system and tissue healing. i couldn't find studies relating secondhand nicotine exposure to surgical outcomes. the prudent option would be to avoid exposure as much as possible leading up to your surgery, but it's unlikely secondhand exposure would significantly affect your risk or outcome.

if you've been routinely exposed to secondhand vape, nicotine would probably not be detectable in your body after a period of several days to a week of non-exposure. however, nicotine and its health effects are not the only concerns with secondhand smoke/vapor - there are many other harmful substances that can affect health too.

overall, i'd suggest discussing this concern with your surgeon or healthcare provider, who knows your medical history and specifics of the planned procedure best. ask your spouse to vape outside or in a different room in the meantime to reduce your exposure."
N132,response_14,"unless your husband is vaping directly in your face or you are in a very small confined room with no ventilation, the amount of secondhand exposure to nicotine you would have is not likely to be problematic for your upcoming surgery. however, it's always a good idea to limit exposure to any kind of secondhand smoke or vape as much as possible due to the potential health risks. prior to your surgery, you should share your concerns and full health and environmental conditions with your surgeon or anesthesiologist who can guide you properly according to your medical condition. you should also ask your husband to vape in a different room from you, or outside, if possible, especially before your surgery. nicotine clears from the body within a few days. but again, precautions are good since the exact influence of secondhand vape on surgical outcomes has not been thoroughly studied yet."
N132,response_15,"secondhand vaping is less studied than secondhand smoking, but emerging studies suggest it can lead to some level of exposure. however, the level of exposure from secondhand smoke or vapor is substantially less than the level for primary users. that being said, it's difficult to say with absolute certainty whether it would impact wound healing or anesthetic complications from your surgery. it's very unlikely based on typical levels of exposure, but you might want to have your husband vape outside or away from you, just as a precautionary measure, especially around the time of the surgery. additionally, it's recommended to bring up this concern with your surgeon or anesthesiologist prior to your operation."
N132,response_16,"while vaping may not expose the individuals around to the same amount or kind of chemicals as traditional cigarettes, it does still produce some secondhand exposure. however, the health effects in relation to surgery, are unknown at this stage.

the primary concern with nicotine and anesthesia relates to direct use rather than secondhand exposure. nicotine can constrict blood vessels, which can potentially increase the risk of complications during and after surgery. however, this is mainly a concern for individuals who smoke or vape themselves.

based on the information you provided, i don't think you need to be overly worried. but if it still concerns you, consider discussing it further with your surgeon or anesthesiologist. they can give you information based on your overall health and specific scenario.

it's always a good idea to avoid secondhand smoke/vape as much as possible, but in your case, it seems unlikely to cause significant surgical risk.

to answer your question about how long it would take nicotine to clear your system, nicotine has a half-life of about 2 hours in the body. this means that roughly half of the nicotine you've been exposed to would leave your system in about 2 hours. it would take about five half-lives, or approximately 10 hours, for the nicotine to be virtually eliminated. nevertheless, traces of its metabolite cotinine, can be detected in your body for up to three days after your last exposure to nicotine. of course, this primarily applies to people who smoke or vape themselves; the amount and rate of absorption from secondhand exposure would likely be much less."
N132,response_17,"second-hand vapor from e-cigarettes might still contain harmful substances, but it's unclear how significant the impact might be. nonetheless, it is best to avoid such exposure especially preceding a planned surgery, as it's known that nicotine can affect your body in various ways potentially complicating the surgery and healing process. even though you aren't a smoker, passive intake of nicotine from secondhand smoke or vapor may lead to having your body affected by it, especially when you're subjected to it on regular basis. 

there are mixed theories and no consensus on how long it takes for passive nicotine intake to be completely cleared from the body. generally, clearance is completed within a few days (3-4 days) to a week after cessation of exposure. however, these timelines may be different for each person depending on multiple factors.

in preparation for your arthroscopic surgery, it may be best to consider being in a different room from your spouse while he is vaping or ask him to vape outside. also, it is always best to discuss these concerns with your surgeon or anesthesiologist prior to your surgery. they will have specific recommendations based on your particular situation and their own practices."
N132,response_18,"it is great that you are seeking knowledge on how to optimize your health & potential surgery outcomes. second-hand smoke or vape can indeed lead to some nicotine exposure. it is unlikely to be as high as a direct smoker, but it could still have some potential impacts.

nicotine is known to constrict blood vessels, potentially impairing blood flow to healing tissues, and can also affect the functioning of certain types of cells involved in healing. also, it can impair lung function leading to more respiratory complications in the perioperative period. 

however, the specific quantity of exposure that would lead to clinically significant effects is hard to establish and likely varies among individuals. 

you can reduce your risk by avoiding exposure to nicotine in the weeks leading up to your surgery. nicotine is usually cleared from the body within a few days, but the effects on blood flow might persist for a few weeks. 

closing the door, using a fan to direct vapor away from you, opening windows, or ventilating rooms where vaping occurs are simple measures that can be implemented. 

of course, the best option would be for your spouse to potentially cease vaping, at least indoors, in the weeks leading up to your surgery. besides, it is also an opportunity to discuss with your spouse the potential health risks linked to his high nicotine usage.

remember to discuss this and all the other questions with your surgeon and anesthetist before the procedure. they will likely perform some tests that could potentially highlight any issue before the surgery. 

stay safe and wish you a successful recovery after your surgery!"
N132,response_19,"while secondhand smoke exposure from traditional cigarettes can indeed have negative health outcomes, it is still under study how much of that holds true for secondhand exposure to electronic cigarettes (vaping). 

nicotine does indeed restrict blood vessels which can complicate surgery and recovery, but the amount secondhand from vaping is quite minimal. if you're still concerned, i would recommend asking your husband to vape in a different room or outside in the weeks leading up to and following your surgery.

while there isn't a clearly defined timeline for clearing the body of secondhand nicotine exposure, a full month should be more than sufficient.

regardless, i would recommend discussing this with your surgeon or anesthesiologist before the operation for peace of mind, but overall i would expect your exposure and risk to be quite low."
N132,response_20,"secondhand smoke (including vape smoke) can affect you and contribute to a variety of health problems. however, it's unlikely to have a substantial enough impact on your surgery to create any significant risks, especially for a relatively small procedure like wrist arthroscopy. it would be best, though, if your spouse could reduce or stop vaping indoors or around you to limit your passive exposure.

the half-life of nicotine in the body is about 2 hours, which means it takes around this time for half the amount of nicotine to leave your body. but complete clearance of the drug (and its metabolites) can take longer, and could potentially take up to 48-72 hours for most individuals.

to be on the safe side, it may be best to avoid any exposure to secondhand vape smoke for a few days before your surgery. inform your surgeon or anesthesiologist if you're concerned about this, as they can provide you with more personal advice tailored to your situation."
N132,response_21,"secondhand smoke from e-cigarettes, or vapes, can potentially expose bystanders to nicotine and other toxic substances. however, the level of exposure would likely be far less than someone who actively smokes, thus the risk in terms of anesthesia and surgery are likely very minimal.

that being said, it's best if your spouse could avoid vaping in your immediate vicinity, particularly in enclosed spaces, to further minimize your passive exposure. as for how long it would take for any nicotine you're passively inhaling to clear from your system, it's difficult to say exactly as that would depend on many factors including the exact level and duration of exposure, but as a rough guide, generally nicotine can be detected in the body for about three days after exposure in most cases.

as always, you should inform your anesthesiologist about your potential exposure to secondhand vape smoke. they may want to take it into account when planning your anesthetic.

please note that even though the nicotine content might be less damaging in terms of anesthesia, secondhand smoke from e-cigarettes can carry other health risks; studies have found toxic and cancer-causing substances in the aerosol exhaled by users. it is best for your overall health if your husband could smoke outside or ideally quit altogether."
N132,response_22,"while it is well known that direct consumption of nicotine and other tobacco related chemicals can interfere with healing post surgery, the impact of secondhand exposure from vaping is less defined. as vaping is relatively new, research is ongoing regarding its health impacts. a 2014 study published in the journal of the american medical association found that short-term exposure to most types of e-cigarettes can lead to acute endothelial cell dysfunction, but long-term impacts are less known.

regardless, it's always a good idea to reduce any potential risks. also, you want to have the best healing process post-surgery. 

the best thing that you can do is to discuss this situation with your surgeon or anesthesiologist. they can provide you with the most accurate information based on your current health and the type of surgery you are going to have. 

while you might not be exposed to the same volume or concentration of nicotine as a direct user, the impact could still be significant especially if the exposure is inside a confined space and it's happening regularly. nicotine itself (regardless of source), is generally cleared from the body within a few days of cessation.

if it's possible, it would be beneficial to avoid exposure to your husband's vaping at least a few weeks before and after your surgery, if not entirely."
N132,response_23,"the concentrations of nicotine in secondhand smoke are generally extremely low in comparison to the concentrations in a smoker or, in your case, a vaper. given this, it is highly unlikely that secondhand nicotine exposure would reach a level that would cause any issues during a surgical procedure or during the healing process. for reference, it generally takes about 48 hours for nicotine to be fully cleared from the body. however, if you are concerned, try to avoid staying in the same room while your partner is vaping or ask him to use the vape outside until your surgery and recovery are over. remember, passive smoking is harmful, especially if exposed over a long period of time, regardless of the situation being discussed here."
N132,response_24,"the effect of secondhand smoke on anesthesia and recovery is not as thoroughly studied or as well understood as that of direct smoking. however, it's generally recommended to avoid secondhand smoke due to its associated health risks, including respiratory and cardiovascular issues.

the amount of nicotine absorbed from secondhand smoke or vapor from electronic cigarettes is much lower than directly smoking or vaping. in general, the nicotine subjects are exposed to from varying degrees of secondhand smoke is significantly lower and often negligible. however, vapor from e-cigarettes can contain a number of harmful substances besides nicotine, such as formaldehyde and other toxic chemicals.

if you are concerned, it might be a good idea to have a convo with your spouse about limiting exposure - maybe he could use a different room to vape or at least far from you, especially prior to your surgery - this will do more to protect your respiratory system and reduce the chances of any potential surgical complications. it's also always beneficial to mention this to your anesthesiologist and surgeon so they're aware of your situation, even if the risks might be low.

as for how long nicotine takes to leave your body, on average, nicotine can be detected in the blood for about three days after use. however, passive smoke exposure is likely to produce only negligible amounts of nicotine in your system if any."
N132,response_25,"secondhand vaping has not been extensively studied and the level of trace nicotine you are exposed to is likely much lower than directly inhaling. however, we do know that any exposure to nicotine can theoretically impact wound healing. this can cause problems like increased risk of infection, wound dehiscence (separation of the wound edges), and delayed healing. 

nicotine has a half-life of approximately 2 hours in the body, which means that it takes around 2 hours for the nicotine concentration to decrease by half. after about 6 half-lives, or about 12 hours, the nicotine is effectively out of your body. 

if you're concerned about your exposure, the best course of action would be to have a discussion with your spouse about the situation. perhaps he could vape outside of the home or use a lower-nicotine vape to decrease your exposure towards the day of your surgery. 

you should also discuss this situation with your physician to make sure they are aware of it in case it does end up making a difference in your surgery or post-operative healing. it's always better to be safe and give your surgical team as much information as possible pre-operatively—so they can make the best decisions for you during your procedure."
