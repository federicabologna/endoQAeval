N133,response_1,"the report shows that the patient's heart is in good condition. the size and function of the left ventricle are normal, with no wall motion abnormalities detected. the ejection fraction (ef) is good, with a percentage of 60.40% (a normal ef is between 50 and 70%). 
the aortic, mitral, and tricuspid valves are also normal, with only trace transvalvular regurgitation in the aortic and mitral valves and mild transvalvular regurgitation in the tricuspid valve. there is no valve stenosis (narrowing) detected. 
additionally, the internal dimensions of the left ventricle are within the normal range. the estimated right ventricular systolic pressure (rvsp) is 26 mmhg. all these values are within the standard range which indicates that heart is functioning well.  
nevertheless, the patient should continue regular check-ups since they have a history of migraines and sarcoidosis, a disease that can potentially involve the heart."
N133,response_2,"your echocardiogram report is generally normal. the left ventricle size is normal with normal systolic and diastolic function. the ejection fraction, which measures how well your heart is pumping out blood, is in the normal range (55-60%). the aortic valve and mitral valve are normal with only trace regurgitation which is usually not significant. the tricuspid valve shows mild regurgitation, which is also usually not a concerning finding. the rvsp value, which is an estimation of the pressure inside the arteries of your lungs, is 26 mmhg which is also within the normal range.

with regard to the measurements, these measurements are all within the normal range: ivsd, lvpwd, lvidd and lvids. the estimated volume of blood in your left ventricle prior to contraction and after contraction (lv esv 2d teichholz and lv edv 2d teichholz) is also represented. the lvot diameter and area are normal as well. the mv peak e velocity and mv peak a velocity, which deal with the flow of blood through the mitral valve, and mv e' lateral are all also reported.

given these results, your heart appears to be functioning well. however, it's always best to consult with the doctor who requested these tests to discuss the results in the context of your symptoms and overall health status. especially since you have migraines and sarcoidosis, it will be important to understand your specific risk factors and manage your health effectively."
N133,response_3,"the echocardiogram study shows that the heart size is normal, without any areas of abnormal movement. the systolic (pumping of blood out) and diastolic (relaxation and filling of heart with blood) functions are normal. 

the aortic valve doesnâ€™t show any thickening or dilation and there is only a trace of backflow of blood (regurgitation). similarly, the mitral valve which is also a part of the four valves that control blood flow in the heart, is normal with only a trace of regurgitation.

the tricuspid valve shows mild regurgitation. right ventricular systolic pressure (rvsp) is slightly increased at 26 mmhg.

all measured values are within the normal range. the ejection fraction (ef) which measures the percentage of blood leaving your heart each time it contracts is 60.40%. this is within the normal range, indicating good heart function.

trace amounts of regurgitation can be considered normal and are often found in healthy individuals. 

overall, this study suggests normal heart structure and function, except for a slight increase in right ventricular systolic pressure and mild tricuspid valve regurgitation, which can be monitored by your doctor."
N133,response_4,"your echocardiogram (an ultrasound scan of the heart) shows that in general, your heart is functioning normally. all values are within standard ranges, demonstrating healthy heart function. the only minor issue noted is mild regurgitation (backward flow of blood) across your tricuspid valve, which is not uncommon and usually not problematic. your cardiologist will be able to provide a more detailed explanation and discuss if any further action is necessary."
N133,response_5,"this echocardiography report indicates a few key things:

1. the size and function of the left ventricle are normal. the size of this portion of the heart is not enlarged and it is pumping an appropriate amount of blood with each heartbeat (this is indicated by the estimated ejection fraction (ef) of 55-60%. this is within the standard range, indicating normal function).

2. the aortic, mitral, and tricuspid valves (all valves in the heart) appear to be functioning well overall. there is a slight amount of leakage (regurgitation) in the aortic and mitral valves, and mild leakage in the tricuspid valve. this is not typically a cause for concern unless it is severe or causing symptoms.

3. the estimated rvsp (right ventricular systolic pressure) is 26 mmhg, which is within the normal range. this suggests that there is no elevated pressure in the arteries that supply blood to the lungs.

4. other measurements about the size and volume of the left ventricle are also within normal standards, suggesting that the overall structure and function of the heart is normal.

overall, this report suggests that the heart is functioning well and there are no significant heart valve problems. these results, however, need to be interpreted by the primary care physician or a cardiologist, considering the patient's clinical situation and other diagnostic test results."
N133,response_6,"your echocardiogram results appear to be mostly normal. here are some details:

1. the size and function of your left ventricle, the main pumping chamber of the heart, are normal. the ejection fraction (ef) is within normal range referring that the heart is pumping out enough blood with each beat.

2. the aortic valve looks normal and no problems like narrowing (stenosis) or leakage were noted.

3. the mitral valve, which is between the left atrium and left ventricle, also appears normal with no sign of narrowing or significant leakage.

4. there is mild regurgitation (leakage) through the tricuspid valve (valve between the right atrium and right ventricle). the estimated right ventricular systolic pressure is 26 mmhg which is within normal limits indicating no pulmonary hypertension.

5. the measurements from multiple views of your heart are all within the normal standard range. these specific components are used to look at the structure and function of the heart.

always make sure to discuss these results with your doctor to understand what it means for you. as a 45-year-old woman with a weight of 120lbs, your health conditions can influence these results and future management plans especially if you're experiencing migraines and have a history of sarcoidosis."
N133,response_7,"the results of your cardiovascular study are all excellent: 

- the structures of the left ventricle, aortic valve, mitral valve, and tricuspid valve all appear normal.
- the systolic and diastolic functions of the left ventricle are normal, with an estimated ejection fraction (ef) of 55-60%. this is within the normal range and indicates that your heart is pumping blood effectively.
- there is slight regurgitation (leakage) present in the aortic and mitral valves, but this is trace (very small), and is a common finding in many people.
- slightly more regurgitation is noted in the tricuspid valve (which is located between the right atrium and right ventricle), but it is still considered mild.
- the right ventricular systolic pressure (rvsp) is estimated to be 26 mmhg, which falls within the normal range. this is a measure of the pressure in the pulmonary artery, and can be elevated in conditions such as pulmonary hypertension.
- there are various other measurements given, all of which fall within their respective normal ranges.

of course, these results should be interpreted by your healthcare professional in the context of your symptoms, personal medical history, and other clinical findings."
N133,response_8,"this report is about an echocardiogram (an ultrasound of the heart) for a 45 year old woman, who weighs 120 pounds, has a history of migraines and sarcoidosis (an inflammatory disease that can affect various organs in the body).

the results show that she has normal left ventricular (main pumping chamber of the heart) size and function. her heart valves are mostly normal. the only finding of note is mild transvalvular regurgitation in her tricuspid valve (a little backward leakage of blood). this was estimated to cause a right ventricular systolic pressure (a measure of pulmonary artery pressure) of 26mmhg, which is at the upper limit of the normal range.

the report also includes a number of measurements. the ejection fraction (ef) measures the percentage of blood leaving your heart each time it contracts. her ef is 60.40%, which is normal. the other measurements (lvot sv, ivsd, lvpwd, etc.) are dimensions of the heart and blood flow velocity through the heart valves. all these numbers are within the expected ranges.

generally, this is a reassuring report. however, her physician would correlate these findings with her symptoms, physical examination, and other medical information. she should continue to follow up with her healthcare provider to ensure well-managed care."
N133,response_9,"the results of the study of your heart using imaging show that all the heart chambers and valves are generally in good health. 

the left ventricle (the heart's main pumping chamber) size is normal, with normal movement and pumping function. the estimation of the blood leaving your heart each time it contracts (ejection fraction) is 60.40%, which is considered normal (a normal ef is generally considered 55-70%).

the aortic valve, which controls the flow of blood out from the heart to the rest of the body, is normal with no thickening or dilation. the amount of blood leakage back into the heart (regurgitation) is very small (trace). there's no sign of narrowing (stenosis).

the mitral valve, which controls the flow of blood between the two left chambers of the heart, has a normal structure and the leakage is very small. there's no stenosis.

the tricuspid valve, which controls the flow of blood between the two right chambers of the heart, shows a mild amount of regurgitation. the pressure in your artery that supplies blood to the lungs from the heart (rvsp) is estimated at 26 mmhg, which is considered to be within normal limits.

the other measurements given show the sizes and functioning of the various heart chambers and valves, all of which appear to be within normal ranges. the mitral valve peak velocities of early (e) and late (a) filling wave are also within normal range, which suggests normal left ventricular filling pressures.

please continue to follow up with your healthcare provider to manage your migraines and sarcoidosis, and to maintain your overall heart health."
N133,response_10,"these results of your echocardiogram are for the most part within normal limits. your heart is pumping blood normally, with a visually estimated ejection fraction of 55-60%, which is within the normal range. there is no evidence of any wall motion abnormalities or any significant structural defects. the mild transvalvular regurgitation noted on the tricuspid valve is usually a mild condition and generally does not cause any significant symptoms or problems. the estimated right ventricular systolic pressure (rvsp) is 26 mmhg, which is in the normal range and indicates normal pressure in the right side of the heart. overall, this study does not show any major issues with the heart. u should always discuss these results with your doctor as they can interpret them in the context of your health history and current condition."
N133,response_11,"this echocardiogram report shows that your heart is generally functioning well. the left ventricle (the main pumping chamber of the heart) size is normal, there are no wall motion abnormalities noted, and the systolic function and diastolic function are all normal. the ejection fraction, a measure of how well your heart is pumping out blood, is within normal range at 60.40%.

the aortic, mitral, and tricuspid valves (which control blood flow in your heart) are all functioning well with no evidence of stenosis (narrowing). there is mild regurgitation (backward flow of blood) across the tricuspid valve, which is generally not of major concern. the estimated right ventricular systolic pressure (rvsp) is slightly elevated at 26 mmhg, suggesting there may be a small amount of pressure on the right side of the heart.

in terms of your other measurements such as the left ventricle outflow tract stroke volume (lvot sv), interventricular septum thickness (ivsd), left ventricle posterior wall thickness (lvpwd), left ventricle internal dimension in diastole (lvidd), and left ventricle internal dimension in systole (lvids) are all within normal ranges.

overall, this report indicates a well-functioning heart. however, given your history of migraines and sarcoidosis, it is essential to continue monitoring your heart health closely. remember to consult with your healthcare provider if you have any symptoms or concerns."
N133,response_12,"this report looks like part of the results of an echocardiogram or ultrasound of your heart which looks at the heart's size, shape, and how well your heart's chambers and valve structures are working. here are the main findings:

1. left ventricle: this chamber of the heart has normal size and function. the ejection fraction, which is how much blood the left ventricle pumps out with each contraction, is between 55-60%, which is within the normal range.
2. aortic valve: the structure responsible for controlling the outflow of blood from the heart to the body has no significant abnormalities and only small amounts of regurgitation (blood going back through the valve, going the wrong way).
3. mitral valve: the valve regulating blood flow from the left atrium to the left ventricle also shows no significant abnormalities and, again, only small amounts of regurgitation.   
4. tricuspid valve: this is the valve on the right side of the heart responsible for delivering blood to the lungs. here, there is mild regurgitation, but this is generally an insignificant finding and commonly seen in normal hearts. the pulmonary artery pressure (rvsp) appears to be normal.

all other measurements are also within normal limits. so, overall, the structure and function of the heart as seen on the ultrasound appear normal. however, you should discuss these results with your physician to understand them in the context of your personal medical history and condition. these results only provide part of the overall picture of your health."
N133,response_13,"this test provides information about the individual's heart health. the results seem to show no significant health concerns.

in the narrative section:
- the left ventricle size is normal with 55-60% of blood being pumped out with each heartbeat (normal systolic function).  
- the aortic valve (which separates the heart and aorta) has no thickening or dilation, and no significant regurgitation (backward blood flow).  
- the mitral valve (between the left atrium and left ventricle) also appears normal with no significant regurgitation or narrowing (stenosis). 
- the tricuspid valve (on the right side of the heart) has mild regurgitation which is not usually a cause for concern in isolation. the estimated right ventricular systolic pressure (rvsp) of 26 mmhg is within the normal range. a high rvsp could indicate conditions such as pulmonary hypertension.

in the component results section:
all specified measurements of the heart structure and function are within normal ranges or not significantly abnormal, which is a good sign. it indicates that the heart is pumping blood efficiently, and the heart chambers and valves are functioning appropriately. 

as always, follow up with your healthcare provider for a full interpretation and understanding of these results, particularly within the context of your overall health, medical history, and any symptoms you may be experiencing."
N133,response_14,"this report details the results of your heart examination. in summary, everything appears normal. 

starting from the top, the size of the left ventricle (the main pumping chamber of the heart) is normal and its function is also normal with a ejection fraction (ef - the percentage of blood that's pumped out of a filled ventricle with each heartbeat) of 55 - 60%, which is a normal range. 

the aortic valve (which allows blood to flow from the heart to the rest of the body) is also normal with no thickening or dilation. however, there is a small amount (trace) of backward leakage of blood (regurgitation) but no narrowing (stenosis). 

the report talks about similar findings for the mitral valve (which regulates the flow of blood from one chamber of the heart, the left atrium, to another, the left ventricle). there's no abnormality noted in the structure and a small (trace) amount of backwards leakage of blood, yet no narrowing. 

then we see that there is mild backwards leakage of blood (regurgitation) in the tricuspid valve (which controls the flow between the right atrium and right ventricle of the heart). the estimated right ventricle systolic pressure (rvsp), a measure of the pressure in the right side of the heart, is 26mmhg. this is considered within normal range considering your age, sex, and health status. 

the next part of the report lists normal values for different heart measurements. these measurements help doctors evaluate the size and function of your heart. you can see that your values are within the specified standard ranges, indicating that your heart is in good condition."
N133,response_15,"the results above represent an evaluation of your heart using an ultrasound, or echocardiogram. 

the assessment of the four main valves of your heart (aortic, mitral, tricuspid and pulmonic) shows they are all generally healthy. there is a mild amount of blood flowing backwards (regurgitation) through your tricuspid valve, which may not be significant but indicates some level of abnormality. 

your left ventricle, which is the main pumping chamber of the heart, appears healthy. its size and the thickness of its walls are normal, and it is pumping out an appropriate amount of blood with each heartbeat (estimated to be between 55 and 60%, which is normal). also, the systolic function which measures how well your heart is pumping out blood is normal. 

the various measurements listed (e.g., ivsd, lvidd, etc.) refer to different aspects of your heart's structure and function. all values are within the standard ranges, indicating normal function. 

overall, these results appear generally reassuring, but the mild regurgitation through your tricuspid valve may need to be monitored. as with any health concern, it is important to have a discussion with your healthcare provider for correct interpretation of these results in the context of your overall health."
N133,response_16,"this report shows the results of an echocardiogram. overall, it appears that the heart is functioning as expected. the left ventricle, aortic valve, and mitral valve are all normal. there is mildly increased regurgitation (blood flowing backward) in the tricuspid valve, but this is usually not a concern unless it's causing symptoms. the estimated right ventricular systolic pressure (rvsp) is 26 mmhg, which falls within the normal range, so no signs of pulmonary artery hypertension are observed. the values given for heart size and function (e.g. ejection fraction, lvot sv, ivsd, lvids) are all within the standard ranges, indicating healthy heart function."
N133,response_17,"the results suggest that you have a normal heart structure and function. the left ventricle is normal and there are no wall motion abnormalities. the systolic function is normal with an estimated ejection fraction of 55 - 60%. the diastolic function is also normal. the report also indicates that there are no abnormalities with the aortic valve and the mitral valve. the tricuspid valve shows mild transvalvular regurgitation, which could indicate that some blood is flowing back into the heart chamber before it properly flows out. however, this is often not a cause for concern unless the regurgitation is severe or it's causing symptoms. your doctor may want to monitor this over time."
N133,response_18,"this is an evaluation of the heart (echocardiogram) showing largely normal function. the left ventricle (lv), the main pump of the heart, has normal size, wall function and pumping function (ejection fraction, ef is 60.4% within standard limits of >55%). the heart valves (aortic, mitral and tricuspid) show common, minimal backflow of blood (trace to mild regurgitation), but are otherwise normal. the estimated right ventricular systolic pressure, often used as a surrogate for pulmonary artery pressure, is 26 mmhg, which is at the upper limit of normal.

the measurements of the left ventricle and valves are within normal range, as is the flow of blood through mitral valve. all in all, this study does not show any significant issues with the heart's structure or function. regarding your conditions, migraines and sarcoidosis, there is no direct impact seen on the heart from this study."
N133,response_19,"this appears to be the report from an echocardiogram, which is a scan used to look at the heart and surrounding blood vessels. the results seem to indicate the following:

- left ventricle: the size and function of the left ventricle appear to be normal with an ef (ejection fraction, or the percentage of blood leaving the heart at each contraction) of 55-60%, indicating a normal heartâ€™s pumping ability.
- aortic valve, mitral valve: these two valves in the heart seem to be functioning normally with only trace regurgitation (backward flow of blood). no thickening or stenosis (narrowing) is noted.
- tricuspid valve: there is mild regurgitation and no stenosis. the pulmonary artery pressure (rvsp) is estimated at 26 mmhg, which is at the upper limit of normal.  

- the component results are all within normal or near-normal limits, including measurements such as interventricular septum thickness (ivsd), left ventricle posterior wall thickness (lvpwd), left ventricle interior diameter during diastole (lvidd) and systole (lvids), left ventricle end-systolic and end-diastolic volumes (lv esv and lv edv), left ventricle outflow tract (lvot), mitral valve peak flow velocities (mv pk e vel, mv pk a vel).

these results should be interpreted by a cardiologist for full understanding of their implications, taking into account the patient's history and presenting symptoms. the report does not indicate any urgent concern regarding cardiac function. the mild tricuspid regurgitation could be due to a number of causes, and may be the focus of further examination if the patient is experiencing symptoms potentially attributable to the heart."
N133,response_20,"the study results show a normal functioning of your heart.

- left ventricle: normal size and work. 
- aortic, mitral, and tricuspid valves: no issues observed. a small amount of backflow in the aortic and mitral valves (trace transvalvular regurgitation) and mild backflow in the tricuspid valve are common findings and usually do not cause symptoms.
- the estimated right ventricular systolic pressure (rvsp) is 26mmhg, which is considered within normal range.

the component results also show a good functioning of your heart:

- ef (ejection fraction): the percentage of blood that's pumped out of a filled ventricle with each heartbeat. your ef is 60.40%, which is within the normal range (50-70%).
- lvot sv (left ventricular outflow tract stroke volume): the volume of blood pumped by left ventricle per heartbeat in your case is 65.8cm3, which is normal.
- ivsd (interventricular septal end-diastole): the thickness of the septum that separates the left and right ventricles of your heart is 0.76 cm, which falls within the normal range of 0.6 - 1.1 cm.
- lvidd (left ventricular internal dimension in diastole) and lvids (left ventricular internal dimension in systole): your measurements are within the standard range, indicating normal sizes of your left ventricle.
- the rest of your measurements strike to be within normal range indicating good functionality overall.

remember, if you still have concerns, always consult with a healthcare professional."
N133,response_21,"this report shows the results of an echocardiogram (an ultrasound test of the heart). from the narrative:

- the left ventricle is of normal size and function, with no abnormalities noted.
- the aortic valve looks normal, with only trace amounts of leakage (regurgitation).
- the mitral valve also appears normal with only trace amounts of leakage.
- there is mild leakage seen in the tricuspid valve. the pressure in the right side of the heart (rvsp) is slightly elevated at 26 mmhg.

the component results all appear within normal limits. the ejection fraction (ef) is 60.4%, which is in the normal range, indicating that the left side of the heart is pumping out a normal amount of the blood it receives. other measurements of the heart's structure and function all fall within the standard range. these results suggest that the heart is structurally and functionally normal. however, the mild tricuspid regurgitation and slightly increased rvsp could signal some pressure changes in the heart, and should be monitored. these changes could be related to the patient's sarcoidosis. it's recommended to continue follow-up with a healthcare provider for ongoing management.

please note, the above information interprets test results in a general sense, and does not take into account the comprehensive medical picture of the patient. final interpretation should be done by a medical professional familiar with the patient's medical history and current condition."
N133,response_22,"the results of your echocardiogram are normal. 

the left ventricle is of normal size and function, with an ejection fraction (ef) of 60.4% (within the normal range of 55-75%). the ejection fraction is a measure of how well the heart is pumping. 

the aortic, mitral, and tricuspid valves show no signs of thickening or stenosis (narrowing). trace amounts of regurgitation (backward flow of blood) were noted in the aortic and mitral valves, but this is not usually a concern if the heart is otherwise normal. mild regurgitation was noted in the tricuspid valve, which is also generally not a concern. 

the end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes, which measure the amount of blood in the heart at the end of a resting phase and of a contraction phase respectively, are also within normal ranges. 

overall, this report indicates a strong healthy heart function. continue to follow up with your doctor for your migraines and sarcoidosis."
N133,response_23,"this is an echocardiogram report, which evaluates the structure and function of the heart. the measurement results indicate that the left ventricle size and function, as well as the aortic, mitral, and tricuspid valves, are within normal ranges with no significant abnormalities. the measurements of the left ventricle's function (ejection fraction, or ef) and dimensions are within normal limits. 

however, there is mild regurgitation (backflow of blood) noted in the tricuspid valve. this may not be necessarily serious in isolation and is sometimes seen in otherwise normal hearts.

the estimated right ventricular systolic pressure (rvsp) is 26 mmhg, which is near the upper limits of normal. this could indicate a bit of pressure in the lung circulation.

N133,response_24,"this is an echocardiogram report of a 45-year-old female who has a history of migraines and sarcoidosis. the echocardiogram is a test that uses ultrasound to create images of the heart which provides detailed information about its structure and function.

the report indicates normal left ventricle (major chamber of the heart responsible for pumping blood to the body) size and no abnormalities in its wall movement. its systolic (when the heart contracts to pump blood out) function is normal with an ejection fraction (ef) of 55 - 60%. this value represents the percentage of blood that's pumped out of the heart with each beat - normal values are between 50-70%. the diastolic (when the heart relaxes to fill with blood) function also appears to be normal.

no abnormalities are found in the aortic valve (the valve between the left ventricle and the aorta which distributes oxygenated blood to the body) and mitral valve (the valve between the left atrium and left ventricle). a small amount of blood leakage (regurgitation) is observed but it is insignificant (trace). 

mild regurgitation is noted in the tricuspid valve (the valve between the right atrium and right ventricle). the right ventricular systolic pressure estimated at 26 mmhg is within normal ranges. 

the other measurements provided relate to different aspects of the heart's structure and performance during different parts of the cardiac cycle. they all appear to be within normal ranges. this includes measurements relating to the ventricles' size and function, and the function of the heart's valves.
