N163,response_1,"i'm an ai developed by openai and not a doctor, but i can provide some general advice for you. 

your persistent oral thrush is concerning, especially given the extent of treatment you've received. often, recurrent oral thrush is associated with underlying conditions that compromise the immune system such as diabetes or hiv. however, seeing as your hiv tests have returned negative, there might be other conditions or factors at play here. 

ehlers-danlos syndrome can sometimes be accompanied by immune or auto-immune disorders. in fact, gastrointestinal problems, including dysbiosis (an imbalance in the gut microbial community), are common in individuals with ehlers-danlos syndrome. your gastrointestinal issues might also be contributing to your recurrent thrush.

few things to consider would be:
1) your diet. high sugar diets contribute to candidiasis. you mentioned limiting your sugar intake, which is good. 

2) your oral hygiene. try to brush your teeth and use mouthwash regularly, while changing your toothbrush frequently to avoid re-infection.

3) underlying conditions. further testing might be necessary to uncover any hidden conditions which may be contributing to this issue.

4) you also mentioned a wbc count being raised previously, this may also indicate an infection or inflammatory condition.

lastly, regarding your medication, long term use of antifungal drugs, especially azoles like itraconazole and fluconazole, could lead to antifungal resistance, but it is relatively less common in strains of candida that cause oral thrush. it is, however, something to bear in mind.

overall, your best course of action would be to continue seeking professional help and ask your healthcare provider about the possibility of any contributing factors causing your persistent oral thrush. please, ensure you discuss the persisting nature of your symptoms with them.

remember, this advice is intended to be general in nature, and specifics may not apply to your personal health circumstances. always consult with a healthcare provider for accurate information."
N163,response_2,"i'm an artificial intelligence and i'm not a doctor, but i can give you general advice on how to proceed. first of all, it's so important that you're seeking the help of medical professionals about your condition. you've already done a lot of testing, so hold onto the results and take them to your specialist appointment.

in terms of your ongoing oral thrush, when medication doesn't help it's important to rule out any possible causes or contributing factors. health conditions that compromise the immune system or alter the body’s normal flora can make you more susceptible to oral thrush. other risk factors include wearing dentures, having certain health conditions like cancer, diabetes, vaginal yeast infections, long term use of corticosteroids, etc. discuss these possibilities with your healthcare provider.

you're doing a good job with frequent changes of toothbrush & avoiding sugar as oral hygiene is a critical part of managing oral thrush. using a tongue scraper might help clean your tongue more effectively, and you may consider probiotics, as they can help replenish beneficial bacteria. drinking unsweetened cranberry juice might also help prevent the overgrowth of yeast.

lastly, it's good that you're addressing your gastrointestinal issues, as a problem in the gut can sometimes manifest in the mouth. your specialist may suggest further testing to see if your oral thrush and gi symptoms are connected.

remember to discuss all these information with your healthcare provider. this is just general advice and might not be exactly applicable to your situation as i lack your full medical history and the ability to examine you in person."
N163,response_3,"i'm an ai developed by openai and while i can't diagnose your condition or substitute for a healthcare professional's advice, i can provide some general information. it seems like your oral thrush has become particularly resistant to standard treatments. recurrent or persistent oral thrush can be seen in those with weakened immune systems, but can also occur due to a number of other reasons, for example:

- imbalance in the natural oral microbiota: this could happen due to antibiotics or other medications that affect the normal bacterial flora.
- smoking: tobacco increases the risk of oral candidiasis.
- poor oral hygiene: brushing teeth twice a day, flossing daily, and getting a dental check-up every 6 months are recommended for maintaining good oral health.
- ill-fitting dentures can also provide a conducive environment for the growth of candida.

it looks like one of your doctors suggested testing the strain of candida to see if it could be a drug-resistant strain, but wasn't able to find a lab to perform the test. that suggestion seems sensible if you can find somewhere else to do it.

the smooth, pink patches you're describing could be due to a variety of conditions, including geographic tongue or even a variant of normal. a dental specialist or dermatologist may be best equipped to assess this.

as for your gastrointestinal symptoms, they can be due to a variety of conditions that are not necessarily related to your oral thrush. it's good you're seeing a specialist for this, monitoring symptoms and maintaining a symptom diary can be useful.

please keep in mind that this advice is intended to be general in nature, and specific causes may not apply to your situation. always consult with a healthcare provider for accurate information."
N163,response_4,"i'm an artificial intelligence and can provide some suggestions, but do consult with your doctor.

persistent thrush can sometimes be due to factors like a weak immune system, untreated diabetes, poorly fitting dentures, dry mouth, smoking, or certain medications. if antifungals don't work, your doctor could consider other options. for instance, there is a medication called amphotericin b, which can be used for severe thrush. 

you can also consider lifestyle modifications such as maintaining good oral hygiene, rinsing your mouth after meals, avoiding mouthwashes or sprays (unless prescribed by your doctor), and quitting smoking if applicable. 

on the other hand, have you also considered getting checked for illnesses like autoimmune conditions or other underlying conditions that might compromise your immune system?

note again, these are suggestions. please consult with your healthcare provider for a complete evaluation and plan customized for you. 

absence of response to multiple therapies might imply that it’s candida resistant to these medications, or perhaps it is not candida causing the issue. hence the need to see a specialist and get more testing."
N163,response_5,"i'm an ai developed by openai and i'm here to provide you with available information, so please note that you should always consult a healthcare provider for personal medical advice.

oral thrush is commonly caused by a fungus called candida. it sounds like you have undergone extensive treatment, however it has not been fully successful so far. there could be various reasons for why your infection is persistent, including resistant strains of candida, low immunity, underlying medical conditions, certain medications, poor oral hygiene, or dietary habits.

hypermobile ehlers-danlos syndrome (heds) doesn't typically cause immunodeficiency, but it is associated with some autoimmune conditions, so it's possible that your immune system is less effective at fighting off this kind of infection. 

further, gastrointestinal issues can be related to candida overgrowth. it might be worth exploring this with your healthcare provider.

if your current treatment isn't working, you do have other options. for instance, some people with thrush that's hard to treat may be prescribed a stronger orally administered antifungal medication, such as posaconazole or voriconazole. 

ultimately, this is something you should discuss with a healthcare provider. they may recommend further diagnostic tests or refer you to a specialist, such as an infectious diseases consultant. 

some lifestyle changes could potentially help as well. for example, you might try brushing your teeth more frequently, flossing daily, and regularly changing your toothbrush to help reduce candida in your mouth. eating a diet low in sugar could also help since sugar can encourage the growth of candida.

remember, my advice is intended to be informational and can't replace the advice of a healthcare provider. it's important that you update them with the progress of your symptoms."
N163,response_6,"i'm an ai language model, and although i'm not a doctor, i can definitely suggest some actions you might want to consider based on your description. 

firstly, persistent or recurrent oral thrush (candidiasis) could indicate an underlying health concern, such as an immune system disorder. if all the tests you've done have come back clear, your doctors may need to consider other relatively less common causes. 

secondly, are you using any form of steroidal inhalers? those may predispose someone to recurrent oral thrush. 

thirdly, although limiting sugar can help reduce the recurrence of oral thrush, a more holistic dietary approach may be investigated. you might consider having a consultation with a dietitian. 

fourthly, it's quite clear that you're dealing with a strain of fungus that's quite resistant to common medication. at this stage, culture and sensitivity tests could help identify the particular strain of candida causing the infection and the most effective antifungal agent against it. it's a concern that you're finding it challenging to find a location to perform this test.

lastly, as you have chronic illness (hypermobile ehlers-danlos), it would be worth discussing with your doctors whether this could have an impact on your oral health and recovery from oral thrush.

please discuss these options with your doctors, as managing your condition seems quite complex and definitely requires a multidisciplinary approach."
N163,response_7,"i'm an ai created by openai, so while i can't physically examine your condition, i can still provide some general advice. persistent oral candidiasis (thrush) could be caused by various factors. here's a list of possibilities:

1. **medication use**: there are certain types of medications that can predispose to candida overgrowth, such as corticosteroids, antibiotics, and oral contraceptives.
 
2. **uncontrolled diabetes**: one of the significant factors that contribute to candida overgrowth is high levels of blood glucose. if you haven't yet, you should have your blood glucose levels tested.
   
3. **poor oral hygiene**: this is usually among the main causes of oral thrush.
 
4. **dry mouth or xerostomia**: certain conditions and some medications can cause dry mouth, predisposing to candida overgrowth.
 
5. **immunodeficiency**: while you've mentioned that you've had hiv and hepatitis tests, there are other factors causing decreased immunity that are worth considering.
  
6. **dietary habits**: diets high in sugar and yeast can cause an overgrowth of yeast.

given that you mentioned gastrointestinal issues, there’s also the possibility that your thrush might be related to an overgrowth of candida in your gut. a specialist in gastroenterology might help with this diagnosis. 

as a next step, you should return to your healthcare provider and consider asking for a referral to a specialist or a different treatment approach. an oral medicine specialist or a specialist in infectious diseases might be helpful.

it also might be worth to consider trying topical anti-fungal treatments along with systemic treatments such as lozenges or troches containing clotrimazole or miconazole or a mouthwash containing nystatin. make sure to keep good oral hygiene. 

this advice does not replace seeing a health professional, and it's important to continue discussing any ongoing or new symptoms with your healthcare provider."
N163,response_8,"from what you describe, it appears you have a persistent case of oral candidiasis (thrush). you have my sympathy; it's a difficult condition to manage and can be very distressing. 

sometimes this can be driven by an imbalance in the natural flora in your mouth. you might consider adding a probiotic containing the bacteria lactobacillus acidophilus to your regimen. this can sometimes help balance the naturally occurring bacteria and yeast in your mouth. you should consult your doctor before starting any new supplement or medication.

oral hygiene is very important. continue to brush your teeth at least twice daily and floss regularly. you might also consider using a chlorhexidine mouthwash. this can help kill off the candida yeast, but like any treatment, it should be used under medical supervision.

diet-wise, you have already reduced sugar which is good. it's also suggested to reduce your intake of yeasty products like bread, as well as fermented and moldy foods - these can potentially increase yeast growth.

as you have an upcoming appointment with a specialist, it's a good idea to discuss these persistent symptoms. sometimes underlying issues like diabetes or certain immune system disorders can contribute to persistent thrush, and it's worth investigating these.

in conclusion, don't lose hope. thrush can be stubborn and recurring, but with the right approach can usually be managed. importantly, keep up with the recommended treatments from your doctor, maintain good oral hygiene, and address potential diet changes and supplements under the guidance of your healthcare professionals.

(nb. i'm not a doctor; always seek professional medical advice.)"
N163,response_9,"i'm an ai language model and i cannot provide medical advice, but i can give you a general understanding of the situation.

oral thrush is a fungal infection in the mouth caused by the candida fungus. this condition usually isn't serious, but it can be uncomfortable, and it can be especially troublesome for people with weakened immune systems. treatment typically involves antifungal medications, and you should continue to take these as prescribed by your doctor until he or she tells you to stop.

the duration and efficacy of treatment can vary significantly from person to person. some people find relief quickly, while others may experience recurring issues or persistent symptoms. side effects can include an unpleasant taste in the mouth, nausea, belly pain, and diarrhea.

practicing good oral hygiene – like brushing your teeth twice a day and flossing regularly – can help prevent oral thrush from recurring. consider replacing your toothbrush frequently if you keep getting oral thrush. 

in terms of diet, some anecdotes suggest that reducing the intake of sugar, yeast, and dairy products may help limit the growth of the candida fungus.

you're doing the right thing in seeking further medical advice because this could be part of a wider issue with your immune system. persisting symptoms despite treatment suggest that there may be an underlying cause which needs to be identified. therefore, taking this further with a specialist is the best way forward. 

please remember, all health concerns need to be evaluated by a healthcare provider - consult yours as soon as possible so you can discuss these considerations with them."
N163,response_10,"i'm an ai developed by openai and i can't diagnose you, but i can offer some general advice. it sounds like this is a complicated situation; ideally, identifying the specific type of candida causing the infection could help guide treatment. you mentioned having gastro issues in addition to oral thrush. both can be associated with an imbalance in your body's normal flora, which can happen for many reasons such as a poor diet, stress, illness, or taking certain medications like antibiotics. 

good oral hygiene is important; you're already changing your toothbrush regularly, which is great. you could also consider using a tongue scraper. 

regarding the issue with sugar, candida thrives on sugar, so limiting your intake might help address the infection. 

you could consider looking into probiotics, which are beneficial bacteria that can help balance your gut flora. of course, this should be discussed with your healthcare provider since you have ongoing health issues.

although usually safe, probiotics can occasionally cause side effects like gas, bloating, upset stomach, and infection. again, this should be discussed with your healthcare provider given your complex health situation. 

lastly, remember to keep any appointments with your specialists. they may be able to further probe into the cause of this persistent infection. if the typical treatments are not effective, it may be necessary to look for an underlying cause that is compromising your immune system's ability to fight off the candida infection. 

this advice is really just to give you some things to consider and discuss with your doctor. please don't change your treatment or start new treatments without discussion with your doctor!"
N163,response_11,"i'm an ai language model, so i'm not a doctor, but i'll do my best to provide some guidance. 

it sounds like you've been trying multiple antifungal medications with varying effectiveness. your persistent thrush might be due to some sort of systemic cause or possibly a resistant strain of candida. 

people with a weakened immune system, uncontrolled diabetes, dry mouth, or those who wear dentures are more susceptible to oral thrush. while you haven't mentioned having any of these conditions, your chronic illness and gastro issues may be contributing factors. 

it's important that the cause of the recurrent thrush be identified, hence the recommendation your doctor made to identify the specific type of candida you have. if local labs don't perform the swab, you may want to look for other labs that do, or discuss with your healthcare provider other possible tests to perform.

other strategies to try could include proper oral hygiene and using a toothbrush sterilizer or boiling your toothbrush to kill any yeast. also consider low-sugar or sugar-free diet, and probiotics to restore good bacteria. 

please continue to work closely with your doctors, including your gastroenterologist, who might be able to provide more specific guidance. the information provided herein is just advice and doesn't replace professional medical advice."
N163,response_12,"i'm an ai language model and not a doctor, but i can give you some general advice on persistent oral thrush. it sounds like you've been very proactive in managing your condition. however, it's concerning that despite extensive treatment, you're still experiencing symptoms.

oral thrush is often a sign of a weakened immune system. even though your hiv and hepatitis tests have come back negative, there may be other reasons your immune response is compromised. in addition to this, your gastrointestinal issues, elevated wbc count, and swollen lymph node suggest that you may have an underlying health issue that is yet to be diagnosed.

you mention that you're due to see a specialist soon. this is very important as they may be able to provide further insight into what's going on. in the meantime, maintain excellent oral hygiene. rinse your mouth with saltwater or a prescribed mouthwash after every meal, avoid sugars and yeasts in your diet, and continue to change your toothbrush regularly.

remember, this advice should not replace a consultation with a healthcare professional. discuss all these concerns with your doctor and take their advice on the right course of action."
N163,response_13,"i'm sorry to hear that you're dealing with a stubborn case of oral thrush. recurrent oral thrush can be a frustrating problem and you've already tried multiple therapies typically recommended for it. 

that said, i'm an ai from openai and can provide some general guidelines but ultimately, your doctor's treatment recommendations will be best since they have a complete picture of your health history.

with treatment-resistant oral thrush, it's important to first evaluate potential risk factors that could be contributing, such as poor oral hygiene, wearing dentures (if you do), smoking, dry mouth conditions, and certain medications which can disrupt the oral flora balance. second, ruling out underlying conditions that could predispose you to persistent infections like diabetes or immune system disorders is necessary.

since the commonly prescribed antifungals aren't resolving your thrush, your doctor might need to consider other antifungal agents, such as amphotericin b or echinocandins (like caspofungin or micafungin), although these are not typically the initial treatments of choice and not without their side effects.

oral thrush sometimes needs multiple treatment rounds and might be stubborn. the median duration of treatment reported in various clinical trials is around 2 weeks, but can take longer especially when resistance is encountered.

in the meantime, continue with your efforts in maintaining good oral hygiene, low sugar diet, and taking care of your general health. it might be worth considering probiotics, particularly those that include ""lactobacillus"" strains, which are thought to potentially help restore a healthy balance to your oral microflora. 

please consult further with your healthcare provider or seek advice from an infectious disease specialist to better manage the condition. this suggestion is just meant to give you an idea of what might be the next step, but should not replace direct medical advice. good luck and i hope you feel better soon!"
N163,response_14,"given your case history and the prolonged resistance to antifungal therapy, it's evident that the treatment isn't working as expected. it's necessary for your doctor to evaluate further, through comprehensive medical history, physical examination, and additional laboratory tests. 

while hiv tests have come negative, some immune system disorders can lead to an inability for the body to control candida, leading to resistant and recurrent infection. so, investigating other causes of immune dysfunction may be helpful. here are a few things that your doctor might want to consider:

1. diabetes: uncontrolled diabetes can lead to a higher risk of oral thrush. perhaps you can get checked for blood sugar levels to rule out diabetes. 

2. other autoimmune diseases: it may be necessary to rule out other autoimmune diseases which could impact the immune response. 

3. nutrient deficiencies: deficiency of certain vital nutrients, such as vitamin b12, iron, and folic acid, could also place you at a higher risk of oral thrush. 

4. re-evaluation of diagnosis: lastly, it might be a good idea for your doctor to reassess if this indeed is oral thrush. 

5. gastrointestinal issues: given your gastrointestinal issues, ruling out any underlying infection causing both gastrointestinal symptoms and oral thrush would be helpful. 

6. contact dermatitis: contact dermatitis can occasionally present as an oral rash, which may be exacerbated by constantly changing toothbrushes and using toothpaste. 

you're doing the right thing by following up with your healthcare provider diligently. it may take time, but finding the root cause of your symptoms is the key to successful treatment. 

(i'm an ai and my advice is based on general medical knowledge, you should discuss this information with your healthcare provider for personalized advice. if things get worse, seek immediate medical attention.)"
N163,response_15,"i'm an ai language model and i can provide some general advice, but you should definitely continue consulting with your doctor or healthcare provider. 

repeated infections of thrush can be symptoms of a compromised immune system, such as in hiv or diabetes, but you indicated that you've been tested negative for hiv and you haven't mentioned if you were tested for diabetes. 

some other things to consider:

1. are you taking any medications that can alter your immunity or the normal flora of your mouth? this includes steroids, antibiotics, immunosuppressants, etc.
2. are you wearing dentures? poor denture hygiene can lead to thrush.
3. do you smoke? tobacco can encourage the growth of candida.
4. have you tried other lifestyle modifications, such as reducing stress or yeast-containing foods/drink?
5. is there possible yeast overgrowth in your gut that could be continually seeding your mouth? you mentioned you are dealing with gastrointestinal issues.

you can always seek a second opinion from another healthcare provider. you may also want to discuss a referral to an infectious disease specialist with your current provider. they deal with a range of infections and may provide a more specialized approach to your thrush infection.

if you're dealing with a particularly stubborn or severe case of thrush, your healthcare provider might discuss other treatment options, such as long-term medication, medication to strengthen your immune system, or a combination approach that targets multiple fungal species."
N163,response_16,"i'm an ai model, so i urge you to consult with your healthcare provider or a medical professional regarding your issue. however, it's certainly frustrating when treatments have not been successful. there could be various reasons why oral thrush treatments are not yielding results:

1. frequency of treatment: even if you are following your doctor's instructions for how to use medication, you may need to do so more often because the fungus is resilient.

2. severity of infection: if your infection is particularly severe or has spread, the medication you're using might not be strong enough or you may need a longer course of treatment.

3. comorbid conditions: if you have another health condition such as diabetes or a compromised immune system, it can make it more difficult for your body to respond to treatment.

4. resistance: in some cases, the fungus causing oral thrush can become resistant to the prescribed therapeutics.

given the lack of response to antifungal medications, it may be possible that the underlying cause of your oral issues is not candidiasis, or there may be a mixed infection with bacteria and fungi.

what you could do are:

1. ensure you practice good oral hygiene by brushing and flossing regularly.
2. rinse your mouth with a warm saltwater solution several times a day.
3. avoid foods and drinks high in sugar and yeast.

with your ongoing medical conditions, it would be best to consult with your healthcare provider about the next steps in evaluation and management. this may include finding a medical laboratory that can carry out a culture or susceptibility test of the oral thrush to determine the most effective treatment strategy. also, it would be helpful to explore whether your gastrointestinal issues could be contributing to the recurrent thrush. consulting a dietitian may also be beneficial in modifying your diet to prevent recurrence."
N163,response_17,"i'm sorry to hear that you're dealing with this. it's quite unusual for oral thrush to be so persistent despite aggressive treatment. clearly, your situation is complex, and it's going to take careful discussion with your doctors to get it figured out.

however, some things i'd suggest considering, if you haven't already:
- if you smoke, quitting would be ideal. smoking increases your risk of oral thrush.
- if you're wearing a dental prosthesis, ensuring it is cleaned thoroughly each day.
- reviewing any medications you are taking to identify any that might be predisposing you to oral thrush. there are several types of drugs that could potentially do this.
- seeing an oral medicine specialist.
- getting any denture problems sorted out. (gaps and/or poorly fitting dentures can provide places for candida to grow.)
  
it may also be worth looking at your diet a bit more carefully. some evidence suggests that candida overgrowth can be promoted by a diet high in sugars and refined carbohydrates. a dietitian might be able to provide useful advice about ways to modify your diet to make it less yeast-friendly.

lastly, severe or recurring oral thrush can sometimes indicate an underlying health condition, such as diabetes or a weakened immune system. you've mentioned you had some tests and consults. you may need to revisit these with your doctor to see whether any further tests are needed to rule out underlying conditions. severe/recurrent thrush is not typical in a healthy person, so it's worth investigating why your immune system is struggling with this."
N163,response_18,"i'm an ai language model, so i can't perform medical diagnoses, but i can give you some information based on your description. 

recurrent oral thrush, also known as oral candidiasis, can be difficult to manage and can sometimes be a sign of an underlying condition that affects the immune system. you mentioned that you've tested negative for hiv and hepatitis, but be sure to rule out other conditions such as diabetes, sjogren's syndrome, or certain types of cancer that could potentially weaken immune response.

you mentioned having ehlers-danlos syndrome (eds). although eds doesn't directly cause oral thrush, any chronic illness can potentially stress the immune system, potentially making you more susceptible to infections.

also, the gastrointestinal issues that you've described—wake-up dry heaving, diarrhea, and stomach pain—are concerning. they could be hints towards an underlying condition such as inflammatory bowel disease, an infection, or malabsorption issues, which might indirectly contribute to persistent oral thrush. candidiasis can also affect the esophagus and stomach, which may tie your symptoms together.

it's also important to remember that personal habits, diet, medications, and oral hygiene practices matter. excessive alcohol consumption, smoking, poor oral hygiene, high sugar diets, and use of corticosteroid inhalers or antibiotics can increase the risk of oral thrush.

i see that you're already taking several measures to keep oral thrush in check, like limiting sugar intake, changing toothbrushes often, and using saltwater rinses. these are all good practices. 

however, given your persistent symptoms even after multiple treatments, it is important to continue to work with your healthcare provider. they might refer you to a specialist, such as a gastroenterologist or an infectious disease expert. this situation might also warrant a second opinion, to ensure all possible causes and treatment options are considered. 

remember to seek immediate medical attention if your symptoms worsen or if new symptoms appear."
N163,response_19,"i'm an ai and not a doctor, but i understand your frustration. i can't exactly diagnose your problems, but i can suggest some things you might want to consider.

first, it's important to speak to your healthcare provider about the digestive problems you've been having—nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea aren't normal and could correlate to your persistent thrush. 

it's unusual for oral thrush to be resistant to so many treatments. have you tried any lifestyle interventions, such as limiting refined carbohydrates and sugar, since they can encourage yeast growth, or trying probiotics or yogurt to balance the yeast and bacteria in your gut? 

your immune system could be key—have you been stressed out or not sleeping well? hypermobile ehlers-danlos is a connective tissue disorder which can potentially affect multiple body systems including gastrointestinal and immune systems. 

lastly, note that dentures and certain medications can also promote yeast infections in the mouth, so it's important to ensure optimal oral hygiene.

your healthcare provider might be able to brainstorm other testing options for distinguishing the candida strain. overall, continue working with your healthcare provider and consider seeking a second opinion if necessary. they might be able to offer a personalized treatment plan that works best for you. this is only advice, and you should consult with a healthcare professional for a definite course of action."
N163,response_20,"i'm an ai language model, so i can't examine your tongue or provide a diagnosis. but i can give you some general guidance about oral thrush. oral thrush is typically the result of a yeast infection, most commonly caused by the species candida albicans. when treatments such as diflucan, fluconazole, or nystatin don't work, that could be because of the specific type of candida involved, a resistant strain, or some other health issue. your doctor was right with the recommendation of the oral swab to identify the candida species; it's unfortunate that such a test hasn't been possible.

in terms of what to do next, it's essential to keep close contact with your healthcare provider and keep relaying your symptoms and concerns. they might consider referring you to a specialist, such as an infectious disease consultant or a dentist who specialises in oral medicine. it's also possible they might recall a treatment with a different antifungal you haven't tried yet, such as amphotericin b.

you should further discuss your digestive issues with your healthcare provider, as a persistent candida infection and gut problems might be connected. chronic illnesses like ehlers-danlos syndrome can also complicate things, so you should mention that to every healthcare provider you see.

the changes to your diet are very much along the right lines. keep avoiding sugar, which yeast feeds on, along with other simple carbs. hydrating well, eating prebiotic and probiotic foods, and maintaining a healthy lifestyle can also promote balance in your gut flora.

for your oral hygiene, it's good to change toothbrushes often during infection, but ensure you also sterilize your toothbrush holder as it's a breeding ground for germs.

i hope you'll find a resolution soon. remember––i've given general information here, and it's crucial to get personalized advice from health professionals."
N163,response_21,"i'm sorry to hear about the challenges you're facing with oral thrush. given your history and the lack of response to appropriate treatment, there could be a possibility that there is some resistance to the antifungal agents used or some other underlying conditions that prevent the clearance of the infections such as diabetes, immunodeficiency, etc. 

it is good that you are being seen by a gi specialist, as they may help in exploring whether your gastrointestinal issues could be contributing to the persistence of your oral thrush. 

another approach would be to try alternative or additional antifungal medicines. although itraconazole and other medications you used are generally quite effective against candida, there are others such as voriconazole or posaconazole that can be used. also, oral amphotericin b can be used in particularly resistant cases.

lastly, one thing that i should mention is that it could be of value to get a swab taken from your mouth for culture and sensitivity, as this will definitely identify the organism you're dealing with and the medicines it's sensitive to. if your healthcare provider's office doesn't do it, you could ask them for a referral to a place that does.

however, this is very much a complex case and should be discussed with your healthcare provider who has access to your full medical history, as additional factors may need to be considered."
N163,response_22,"i'm an ai developed by openai and i can provide some general advice, but it is important to keep consulting with your doctor because it seems like you've been dealing with a complex case of oral thrush that hasn't responded well to treatment, and it is definitely important to rule out possible causes, as you have been doing. the cause can range from something simple as improper oral hygiene to something more serious as an immuno-compromised condition, which it sounds like you've been extensively tested for. 

now, there are a couple of things you could consider:

1. topical antifungal agents: they come as lozenges, troches, or oral suspensions, which are 'swished' around the mouth and then swallowed.

2. systemic treatment: some doctors may prescribe an oral antifungal drug such as fluconazole or clotrimazole (mycelex troches). oral drugs are used when topical treatment doesn't work.

3. good oral hygiene: practicing good oral hygiene can prevent some cases of thrush. brush and floss your teeth as directed by your dentist, rinse your mouth with a diluted 3% hydrogen peroxide solution, and replace your toothbrush frequently until the infection is gone.

4. watch what you eat: a diet high in sugar and yeast-containing foods (like bread and alcohol) can encourage candida growth.

5. probiotics: some studies suggest that a probiotic which combats oral thrush, like lactobacillus, taken with an antifungal medication could enhance the effectiveness of treatment. 

but it is very important to keep in constant touch with your doctor because treatment can be modified according to your response. also, it is crucial to investigate the cause of chronic or recurrent oral thrush which can be done under the guidance of your doctor. 
if you're not receiving specialized care for your oral thrush, consider a referral to an ear, nose, and throat (ent) specialist, or an oral pathologist, who can take a close look at your situation and conduct a biopsy if needed to help nail down the underlying cause. they could also potentially do the candida swab that your current doctor mentioned. 

also, good luck with your upcoming appointment regarding your gastro issues - hopefully that can provide further clarity!

please remember that while i strive to provide as accurate and up-to-date information as possible, this advice should never replace seeing a medical professional in person."
N163,response_23,"i'm really sorry to hear you're going through this. it sounds incredibly distressing and frustrating. 

refractory oral candidiasis (persistent oral thrush that doesn't respond to initial treatments) can be a real challenge to manage. given that you've already tried the commonly recommended anti-fungal medications and observed some improvement, but with relapses as soon as the medication is stopped, it suggests that you may have a strain of candida that's resistant to these medications, or that there's an underlying condition causing your immune system to be less able to fight it off.

hypermobile ehlers-danlos syndrome is a complex condition on its own and can be associated with a range of other issues, including immune dysregulation. this may be contributing to the difficulty in clearing the thrush. gut problems can also be related, as the gut is a big part of the immune system and disorder in the gut can impact the body's capacity to keep candida in check.

taking all of this into account, your next steps should likely involve both pursuing further testing (i.e., identification of the strain of candida and its antimicrobial sensitivities) and broadening your approach to address potential underlying issues. 

further testing: you mentioned you have an upcoming appointment with a specialist, which is a great step. identifying the exact strain of candida you're dealing with, its antibiotic resistance profile, and whether or not you may have an overgrowth of candida in other parts of your body (like the gut) might require seeing an infectious disease specialist, a microbiologist, or a gastroenterologist.

broadening your approach: if there are other underlying issues that are weakening your body's defenses against candida, addressing those could significantly improve your body's ability to clear the infection. for example, figuring out and addressing any gut issues, optimizing nutrition, getting on an autoimmune/anti-inflammatory diet, reducing stress, and rebalancing hormones may all help your body fight off the infection. this could involve seeing a functional medicine doctor, a nutritionist, an immunologist, or an endocrinologist.

lastly, a holistic approach to your oral hygiene might also be beneficial, such as the use of probiotic lozenges or mouthwashes, prescription anti-fungal mouthwashes, or essential oils (like tea tree oil), which some studies suggest can help with oral candidiasis.

N163,response_24,"it's clear that you're going through a tough time, and that the frequent treatments for thrush aren't working as hoped. dealing with a stubborn case of thrush can be incredibly frustrating and sometimes humiliating, so your distress is understandable.

thrush is caused by a type of yeast called candida that normally lives harmlessly in our bodies. however, if the balance of microbes in our body is disrupted, or our immune system is compromised, it can multiply and cause an infection.

since your anti-fungal treatment is not working, it's possible that the candida causing your infection is resistant to these medications. in some cases, people need to be given an aggressive treatment plan involving different types of antifungal medications, and possibly for a prolonged period.

regarding your other symptoms (stomach pain, diarrhea), they might not be related to your thrush. it's a good thing you have an appointment coming up with a gastroenterologist, they will help you understand if these symptoms are related to another medical condition.

a few things you could try and discuss with your doctor:

1. probiotics: some evidence suggests that probiotics can help to restore the balance of microbes in our bodies and suppress the growth of candida.

2. oral hygiene: keep your oral cavity clean and dry. brush your teeth at least twice daily and clean your tongue.

3. diet: candida thrive on sugar, so you're doing the right thing by avoiding eating too much sugar. 

from your post, it seems that your doctor advised for a swab of the candida. if facilities around you don't offer that service, maybe ask your doctor for alternative options or if there's a certain online service that can be useful for you.

take care and i hope you find some relief soon!"

chronic oral thrush can be tough to treat, and it seems like you've tried many standard treatments already. it can sometimes indicate an underlying condition affecting the immune system, but you seem to have ruled out many of the more common ones such as hiv and hepatitis.

part of the issue may be related to your intestinal health. the gastrointestinal tract, including the mouth, is home to a community of bacteria known as the gut microbiome. an imbalance in this community can lead to an overgrowth of candida, the fungus that causes oral thrush. which may potentially be contributing to your recurring episodes of thrush. 

in your case, it's crucial to identify and manage the underlying cause or trigger for the repeated thrush infections, and to treat the thrush effectively to prevent it from returning.

given your ongoing symptoms and the complexity of your case, your doctor's recommendation for an oral swab seems very reasonable. it's unfortunate that you're having difficulty obtaining this. perhaps you could talk to your healthcare provider about other possible labs or are there any home kit available for this. 

also, make sure you're practicing good oral hygiene and limiting your intake of foods and drinks high in sugar, as these can contribute to candida growth. you might also ask your healthcare provider about the possibility of introducing probiotics into your diet, which can help introduce more beneficial bacteria into your gi tract and possibly help get the candida under control.

finally, if you haven't done so already, it may be worth seeking a second opinion. as this can be a complex issue, involving different parts of the healthcare system (gastroenterology, immunology, and infectious disease specialties) might be worth pursuing."
