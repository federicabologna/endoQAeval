N31,response_1,"i'm very sorry for what you're going through. it's tough seeing someone you love having to deal with such a serious illness and even harder when they are determined to follow harmful treatments. here are a few suggestions:

1. discuss with her doctor: discuss your concerns with her doctor. they have more authority and may be able to convince her. they may even connect with her on a level that's more relatable or comforting.

2. consultation with a psycho-oncologist: these are experts in the emotional and psychological needs of cancer patients. they might be able to convince her better and help reduce her anxiety or fears.

3. intervention: gather family members and close friends who she values their opinions. have a quiet, calm discussion about your concerns. the aim here is not to gang up on her but to show that there are many people who care about her and have this concern.

4. taking control: if possible, take control of her online purchases or limit her access to dangerous products. 

5. alternative therapies: show her how she can use actual, effective complementary methods alongside her medical treatments. many medical centers include alternative therapies like acupuncture, meditation and yoga in their range of treatments. these are proven therapies and can offer a lot of relief.

6. introduce stories: stories of people who have thrived following medical treatment can also be shared with her. 

7. online communities: there are a lot of online spaces where she can talk with other people going through the same thing. this might make her feel understood and convince her to follow professional medical advice.

even with all these efforts, remember it's ultimately her decision. it's understandably hard to accept this though, especially when someone you love may be making choices that can harm herself. it's essential to also take care of your own mental health during this time. seek therapy or support groups, and make sure you're supported, too."
N31,response_2,"i'm sorry your mom and your family are going through this. cancer is a scary diagnosis and it's not unusual for people to explore other treatments in response to their fear. i would recommend a few steps:

1. **opening a dialogue**: make sure your mom knows you're speaking out of love and concern. this is crucial as she's probably scared and confused, and might perceive it as an attack if it isn't done delicately.

2. **involve the doctors**: ask your mom to bring her research and ideas to her oncologist to discuss. a healthcare professional she trusts might be able to dissuade her, or at least guide her towards safer alternatives.

3. **find a support group**: connect her with people who have gone through similar experiences. hearing the trials and tribulations of others can be eye-opening and grounding in a way facts and figures cannot.

4. **do your own research**: look up what reputable health organizations say about the substances she's interested in. showing her credible information to help back up your concerns may help her understand your point of view.

5. **psychologist/social worker:** also, there may be value in speaking with a psychologist or social worker. they may be able to give you tools to help communicate effectively.

it's a difficult situation, but staying patient and supportive will be essential regardless of her decision. even though it's hard, remember she's the one living with the diagnosis. it might be helpful to also make sure she's not suffering from any mental health issues or disorders that might be influencing her."
N31,response_3,"i'm sorry you're dealing with this. here are some possible strategies for you to think about:

1. empathy and understanding: the first thing is to understand where your mum is coming from. this is an unexpected and terrifying diagnosis for her. wanting to regain control by finding alternative treatments is completely rational, even if the substances she is interested in aren't.

2. clear communication: have an open and honest conversation with your mother. make sure she understands your concerns for her safety. 

3. involve the doctors: if possible, try to have this conversation in the presence of her healthcare providers. they are the best suited to explain why these substances are dangerous and why the treatment they have prescribed is the best course of action.

4. propose alternative therapies: it could be helpful to propose other safer alternative therapies that could complement her prescribed treatment. this could include dietary changes, acupuncture, yoga, and meditation for stress relief.

5. support groups: there are numerous cancer support groups online and possibly in your local community. encourage your mom to join one. it could be beneficial for her to hear from other people going through the same thing about the treatments they have found helpful.

6. enlist the help of family and friends: enlist the help of family, friends, or anyone your mom respects who may have influence over her decision. they could help in making her understand the possible implications of her choices.

7. reputable information: provide her with reliable sources of information on cancer and its treatment. institutions such as the american cancer society or mayo clinic have a wealth of information and resources available online.

always remember to approach with love and care; it is a tough time for your mother too. you're doing your best, don't forget to take care of yourself as well."
N31,response_4,"i'm really sorry to hear about what you and your mom are going through. it's obvious that you care deeply about her well-being and it must be very frustrating to see her choosing a path that you believe is harmful.

consider the following steps:

1. involve medical professionals: if you can, get her to discuss these alternative treatments with her oncologist. medical professionals may have the best chance at explaining why using these substances could be dangerous. 

2. provide reliable resources: share reliable resources and articles with her that discourage the use of such unproven and potentially harmful substances. 

3. emotional appeal: perhaps speaking to her emotionally about your worries, fears and that you are afraid of losing her due to her choosing these treatments, might get through.

4. seek assistance: consider reaching out to a local cancer support group or an oncology social worker who may have experience dealing with similar situations and could provide guidance.

5. therapy: organize a therapy session with a counselor who understands the trauma and emotional turmoil cancer patients go through. they could guide and convince her about the benefits of medical treatment.

remember, your mom is likely scared and is probably trying to find control in a situation where she feels she has none. patience, sympathy, and understanding will go a long way, even if it's hard sometimes. 

if all else fails and she persists with these dangerous treatments, consider speaking to someone about potential legal actions to protect her from causing harm to herself. 

please consider speaking to a mental health professional yourself as well, it's important to take care of your mental health during this time."
N31,response_5,"i'm really sorry to hear about your mom. it's a tough situation and really hard to navigate. here's some suggestion:

* bring her to another doctor for a second opinion: have the conversation about why she doesn't trust the doctor and express your doubts about the mms. if she hears the same thing from another source she respects, it might resonate more.
  
* arrange an online group session with a trusted family therapist: often, when people are faced with a life-changing diagnosis, they might be looking for an alternative explanation or solution. a therapist might help mediate the conversation and validate all feelings involved, which could make her more likely to listen to your concerns.
  
* get in touch with cancer support groups: they often have experienced professionals or other people who've been in the same situation and might provide her with knowledge and insight into the dangers of using such substances and trusting in verified medical treatments.
  
* inform her of the legal consequences: both black salve and mms are illegal in many countries, depending on where you live. if buying or possessing these items goes against the law, it could get her in serious trouble.

* organize a family intervention: ask other family members or close friends who she respects and trusts to voice their concerns and emphasize the importance of sticking to doctor-prescribed treatments.

lastly, always remember that her decisions ultimately are her own. all you can do is love, support, and try to guide her towards better choices. ensure that she understands that these alternatives could pose serious risks to her health and life. it's a stressful and scary time for everyone involved, so take care of yourself as well."
N31,response_6,"i'm really sorry to hear about your mom's situation. this sounds like a very tough time for you both.

here are some recommendations:

1. **take her to a consultation:** consider encouraging your mom to engage in a consultation with a trusted doctor or oncologist. have her list out all her concerns and questions so she can directly discuss them with the physician. maybe hearing about the potential detrimental effects of these substances directly from a medical professional may have more significance. 

2. **support groups:** connect her with cancer support groups as often as possible. they can share experiences, discuss what treatments have worked for them, and allow your mom to see the positive results of conventional treatments.

3. **counseling:** for many people, a cancer diagnosis can lead to feelings of fear, helplessness, and a desire to regain control. it may be helpful for your mom to see a licensed counselor or therapist, particularly one who specializes in patients with severe illness. this can be a valuable resource to work through these feelings. this may also help her to appreciate medical advice more, and possibly dissuade her from turning to unproven alternative treatments.

4. **educate her on reputable sources:** there are many sources available which promote misinformation. guide her towards reputable organizations' websites, such as the american cancer society, national cancer institute, or world health organization, where she can find accurate, evidence-based information about cancer treatment.

5. **involve her in her treatment decisions:** lastly, involve her in every decision, explain to her the pros and cons of legitimate treatments and empower her by letting her know she’s in control of her body and treatment decisions. collaborative decision-making, with her doctor, may make her feel less overwhelmed and less likely to turn to harmful remedies.

remember too that it's important for you to also form a network of support for yourself, whether that's friends, family, or counseling. this is a challenging situation, and you also need to take care of your own mental well-being."
N31,response_7,"i'm sorry you're going through this. it's painful to watch someone you love not only facing a serious illness but making potentially damaging decisions as well.

1. professional help: speak with her doctors and explain the situation. they can provide professional advice and show her documented studies that prove the ineffectiveness and danger of these substances. they might also consider psychological counselling to help her cope with the diagnosis and bring her around to conventional treatment.

2. involve other family members: sometimes advice from children is shrugged off as uninformed. if you have siblings, aunts/uncles or cousins that she trusts, especially if any of them work in the medical field, ask them to help you.

3. interventions: interventions are typically used for addicts, but they can also be effective to change harmful behaviors. gather all family members and friends and confront her together about these harmful practices.

4. use success stories: show her the survivor stories of people who went with the conventional treatment route. you could reach out to cancer support groups where there are many survivors.

5. never give up: continue to voice your concerns calmly and rationally, show her your love, and empathize with her feelings of fear and distrust.

6. find 'natural' reputable cancer treatments: there are institutions and practices that blend conventional and complementary therapies for treating cancer. mayo clinic, for instance, has a 'complementary and integrative medicine program.' if she wants to pursue a more 'natural' route, ensuring it's reputable and approved by her doctors is essential. 

remember that you cannot force your mom to change her mind or make different decisions. ultimately, it's her life and her body. you can only provide guidance, support, and maybe a bit of gentle persuasion."
N31,response_8,"i'm really sorry to hear about your mom's diagnosis. that's a tough spot for both of you to be in and i can understand your concern about her exploring unofficial treatments. here are a few suggestions on what you can do:

1. **consult with your doctors:** speak with her oncologist or attending physician about her plans to self-treat. they're in a position to explain the dangers and the lack of scientific backing behind these alternative treatments. they often have experience dealing with patients who consider alternative treatments and can provide helpful suggestions and information.

2. **invite her to talk to a counselor or a support group:** hearing from survivors or others who've been through this can be very impactful. you could consider a support group where she could connect with others who are going through the same experience.

3. **companionship during treatment:** accompany your mom during her treatment sessions. this will provide her with emotional support and you can have discussions using this time. encourage her to talk more about her diseases and even about these alternative treatments.

4. **educate her on credible sources:** make sure she understands that not everything on the internet should be believed. guide her towards reputable and acclaimed medical sites like mayo clinic or the american cancer society where she can avoid misinformation about her disease.

5. **get a second opinion:** if she doesn’t trust her doctor, consider getting a second opinion or even change doctors. it is important she trusts her care provider fully.

6. **give her love and support:** people often turn to alternatives out of desperation or fear. reassure her that her feelings are valid, but let her know how concerned you are about her health.

this is a tough situation, and also a delicate one. the most important thing is that she doesn't feel attacked or cornered, but supported and cared for."
N31,response_9,"i'm really sorry you're going through this tough time. it may be useful to have a conversation with her doctors to convey what she's doing and how her decisions could potentially affect her treatment. they might be able to provide her with more information and resources so she can make an informed decision about her treatment options.

can you involve other family members or close friends in this discussion? people she trusts and respects their opinion might have a positive influence on her decision-making. she could be feeling scared about this diagnosis and might turn to these ""natural remedies"" out of desperation or as a way to regain control over her situation.

consider bringing in a trained medical professional who specializes in cancer care, such as a cancer coach or nurse navigator. they can help communicate clearly about the disease, available treatment options, side effects, and can help debunk some of the myths and disproved treatments she might be considering.

if she is adamant about using alternative treatments, perhaps originating from a place of wanting to feel a degree of control, you could encourage her to look into legitimate, medically-recognized complementary therapies that can accompany her conventional treatment regime, such as acupuncture, massage, mindfulness practices, etc.

encourage her to join a community of individuals who are also going through the same problems – like a support group for cancer patients. these groups can provide her with emotional support and a grounded understanding of the realities of the disease and its treatment.

remember, while it is crucial to persuade her to reconsider her potentially harmful decisions, she, in the end, remains the decision-maker for her own health. all you can do is provide her with the most accurate and helpful information and support her throughout her journey. also, consider seeking advice or counselling for yourself to better handle this stressful situation."
N31,response_10,"i'm sorry to hear about your mom's situation. this is indeed a tough and emotional scenario. you can approach your mother's situation from these angles:

1. **medical opinion:** ask her to openly discuss these treatments with her oncologist. the doctor can provide the pros and cons of these treatments in comparison to her current treatment plan. if possible, arrange for a meeting with her doctor where you can all discuss this together. 

2. **scientific evidence:** gather scientific research data that shows the ineffectiveness and dangers of these treatments. also, gather strong evidence on treatments that have proven results. presenting her hard facts and figures may sway her thought process.

3. **psycho-social support:** encourage your mom to join a support group with other people going through the same journey. it can be online or in-person (like at the hospital). often, peers going through a similar struggle can provide great insights, support, and share their experiences of what worked or didn't work in their treatment.

4. **showing empathy:** understand that your mother might be going through a lot of fear and anxiety, causing her to grasp for any glimmer of hope. let her know that you understand her concerns, show empathy, and assure her that you want the best for her.

5. **second opinion:** if your mom is not comfortable with her current doctor's approach, it's reasonable to seek a second opinion. this can either confirm the original plan (which may convince her) or may offer alternative treatments that are scientifically proven but perhaps more aligned to her natural preference.

6. **dangers of quackery**: show her articles and news reports which have reported negative results from the use of these alternative methods. there are countless stories of people who have been harmed by unproven treatments. this might help her to see the potential dangers of such substances.

the most important thing to remember is to keep the channels of communication open between you two. your mom needs to know that you're on her side, even if you disagree with her decisions. discuss, but don't argue. you want her to feel supported, not pushed into a certain decision."
N31,response_11,"i'm really sorry to hear about your situation. this must be incredibly stressful for you. here are a few steps you can take:

1. get the doctor involved: your mother might trust a professional's opinion more than yours. her cancer medical team could explain the potential risks and hazards associated with these substances. sometimes, getting it directly from the source can be powerful.

2. use real stories: if there are stories online of people who have been injured or died from using these substances, share these stories with her. emotional narratives can be very persuasive.

3. appeal to her desire to be around for her family: tell her how worried you are about her, and that you need her to stick around for many years to come. encourage her to make decisions that increase those chances.

4. therapy: people diagnosed with cancer are typically offered emotional support services. encourage your mom to speak to a trained therapist about her anxieties and fears. a therapist might be able to make some headway where an emotional family member (you) can't.

5. don't dismiss her fears: it can be very tempting to react angrily when someone is acting in a way that we believe will harm them. however, being compassionate and understanding may keep her open to your concerns and suggestions.

6. if possible, try to involve other family members or her close friends: sometimes a collective voice is stronger than an individual one.

7. you could also discuss her interest with a registered dietitian: registered dietitians are health professionals trained to provide advice and counseling about diet, food and nutrition.

remember none of this is guaranteed to work, but having a calm and collected conversation might help sway her towards the correct course of action. your mom is probably scared and looking for control in an uncontrollable situation. be patient and remember to take care of your own emotional health too."
N31,response_12,"i'm so sorry to hear about your mom's situation, it must be very stressful for you both. here are some ideas you could consider:

1. seek professional advice: find a mental health professional, like a psychologist or counselor, who specializes in counseling patients with cancer. while it's not necessarily a matter pertaining to mental health, a psychologist or counselor might have insights on how to communicate about the situation. 

2. find a trusted doctor: if she's not trusting her current doctors, perhaps she might be open to the opinion of another doctor. is there a trusted family doctor whom she's been seeing for years? if so, that person might also be able to explain the dangers of alternative therapies and importance of medical treatment.

3. communicate fears and concerns: it might be helpful to sit down with your mom and calmly express your fear and concerns about her decision. try to make it more about your feelings rather than her decisions. for example, ""i'm really scared because i love you so much and i'm afraid the alternative treatments might harm you, instead of helping you."" 

4. increase awareness: educate her on what these ""alternative treatments"" do to the human body, especially in cancer patients. look up reputable sites like the mayo clinic or american cancer society to find the facts. 

5. seek help from a 3rd party: consider involving other close family members or friends in the conversation. if other people she trusts express similar concerns, it might persuade her.

6. explore integrative approaches: many cancer centers offer integrative medicine consultations, where patients can learn about complementary therapies that can be safely used in conjunction with cancer treatment.

above all, it's important that your mom feels heard, understood, and supported. understandably, she's probably scared and feels out of control. encourage her to share her feelings and concerns with you, so you can help address them in a productive, safe way.  
remember to also look after yourself in this stressful time and seek support for your feelings too."
N31,response_13,"i'm really sorry to hear about your mom's diagnosis. this is a difficult time for both of you, and it's understandable that she might be looking for alternative treatments, especially if she's feeling frightened or doubtful about conventional medical treatments.

here are some things that you might try:

1. talk to her doctor: the first step could be to inform her oncologist about her intentions. they can explain in medical terms why using unproven treatments could be dangerous or counterproductive. they might also be willing to discuss potential integrative therapies, such as specific dietary changes or supplements, which could complement her current treatment without jeopardizing her health.

2. provide medical evidence: you might also try sharing articles about the harmful effects of the substances she wants to try. try to find articles written by cancer specialists or reputable health organizations like the american cancer society or world health organization. ideally, these articles should include stories of people who have had negative experiences with the substances.

3. psychological help: it could be beneficial to get assistance from a psychologist or counselor, ideally one with experience in oncology. they can provide guidance on how to navigate these difficult conversations and might be able to help your mom deal with her fears and doubts, thereby reducing her desire for alternative therapies.

4. peer support: you may find it useful to connect her with a support group of other patients with her type of cancer. hearing from peers who have had positive experiences with conventional treatments might reassure her, while stories from those who have tried and regretted unproven therapies may help dissuade her.

5. family intervention: you might also consider sitting down with her, alongside other family members or close friends she trusts, to express your concerns. let her know that it's your fear for her safety causing your insistence against these products because you love and care for her. 

most importantly, try to approach each conversation with understanding and compassion. her diagnosis has probably left her feeling scared, confused, and vulnerable, and it's natural for her to look for any possible hope. encourage her to openly communicate her fears both with you and her medical team so she won't feel like she has to find solutions all on her own."
N31,response_14,"i'm so sorry to hear about your mom's diagnosis and that she's resorting to risky methods of treatment. it is understandable that you're worried and it's a situation many people face when their parents are desperate for a solution.

1. **have her talk to her oncologist.** a well-trained medical professional should be able to thoroughly explain the risks and dangers of these substances to her. if possible, accompany your mother to her next appointment to ensure the topic is brought up. 

2. **seek scientific evidence.** pull up reputable sources and scientific studies that refute the effectiveness of these ""miracle"" treatments. 

3. **offer compassion and understanding.** your mother must be afraid and anxious, make sure to approach her feelings with empathy. compassionately acknowledging her fears can sometimes be more effective than heated arguments. 

4. **seek therapy or counseling.** if she’s open to it, talking to a therapist or counselor can help her process her feelings and give her the necessary support to trust the medical process.

5. **involve a trusted third party**. this could be a family member or close friend who she respects and listens to. they may be able to talk to her and steer her away from the harmful substances.

6. **educate her about placebo effects.** many people believe in alternative remedies due to the placebo effect. this could help her understand that just because she may feel better using these substances, doesn't mean they're working to cure her cancer. 

7. **help her see the bigger picture.** people who promote these substances typically don't have medical training or empirical evidence to back their claims. show her how she could potentially harm herself or delay her treatment by using these substances.

remember to keep calm and discuss this topic patiently with her.
given the gravity of her diagnosis, you might also consider legal steps if she continues down this route, but hopefully it would not come to such. 

please consult a professional if you find you're unable to handle this situation or if it worsens. good luck!"
N31,response_15,"i'm really sorry to hear that your mom is dealing with this incredibly tough diagnosis, and that she's choosing to treat her illness in this way. this is a very difficult situation and it's clear you care very much for her.

you might try suggesting she seek a second opinion from another doctor. second opinions can at times corroborate the first opinion or provide alternate treatment methods. also, seeing multiple professionals recommend medical treatment instead of home remedies could help convince her of their importance.

you may also consider bringing in an authority she trusts who doesn't support these treatments. this could be a different doctor, a religious authority, or another respected figure in her life. 

another idea is to find credible sources of information about these substances and treatments. these could be well-respected news outlets, scientific studies, or reports from regulatory bodies like the fda. try to find evidence that specifically addresses the substances your mom is interested in.

additionally, there are therapists and counselors who specialize in working with individuals who have received serious medical diagnoses. if your mother is receptive, speaking to one of these professionals may help her deal with the fear and uncertainty that lead her to these substances in the first place.

lastly, remember that it's very hard to convince someone they're wrong about something, especially when it's something they feel very strongly about. your mom may not be willing to change her mind, as heartbreaking as that is. in that case, it's important to take care of yourself too -- this is an incredibly challenging situation, and your feelings are just as valid."
N31,response_16,"firstly, it's obvious how much you care about your mother and your concern is well-founded. here are a few suggestions:

1. education: continue sharing with her the scientific articles, research papers, pamphlets, and information from reputable health organizations about the dangers of using alternative therapies exclusively. 

2. medical consultation: you might want to bring this up with her oncologist. they may be able to provide her with a comprehensive explanation of why the prescribed regime is the best option and the dangers of alternative methods.

3. counselling: when people get fatal diseases, it's not uncommon for them to turn to unconventional treatments for solace. this can be due to fear or as a method of control. consider involving a counsellor who specializes in cancer patients. having an external party may help in providing a balanced third-party perspective.

4. support groups: encourage her to join relevant support groups where she can interact with those who have undergone similar treatments. hearing real-life stories from those who've battled or are battling the disease may give her a clearer perspective.

5. compromise: if she insists on natural remedies, ask her to consider using these alongside her prescribed treatments and not as replacements.

6. continue expressing love and support: it might seem simple, but she needs to know that she's not alone. your unwavering support may strengthen her trust in the recommended treatment.

remember, this can be a very emotional time for both of you. be sure to look after your own wellbeing too and consider seeking emotional support for yourself."
N31,response_17,"i'm so sorry to hear about your mother's diagnosis and the tough time you're going through. speaking with your mother about her health choices can be tricky, especially if she feels strongly about natural treatments or distrusts the medical establishment. 

first, you may want to discuss this issue with her doctors. tell them about the substances she intends to use. they may be able to explain to her the potential dangers and why they are not recommended. they could also potentially suggest some legally approved complementary therapies which could satisfy her desire for a 'natural' approach while not harming her.

next, you could try to redirect her interest in miraculous cures and natural remedies towards things that are considered safe and potentially beneficial. there are countless alternative practices that might improve her well-being and sense of control without jeopardizing her health, like yoga, meditation, acupuncture, diet adjustments and so on.

try to involve other close family members or friends she trusts. they could help to second your opinion and maybe she will take them more seriously.

finally, a mental health professional (like a psychologist, psychiatrist or medical social worker) might be helpful here. they can provide emotional support to her and also help her to be more open to traditional medical treatments. therapists are trained to discuss issues like this and they may be able to do so in a way that doesn't make your mom feel defensive or misunderstood.

it's important to have patience, understanding and empathy. it's her body and she gets to decide how she wants to treat it. you can only provide her with information and your loving support. if her decisions continue to endanger her life, it may be helpful to seek guidance from a professional who specializes in medical ethics.

remember to take care of yourself, too. it can be easy to neglect your own needs during these difficult times. join a support group, see a therapist or simply make time for things you enjoy."
N31,response_18,"i'm so sorry to hear about your mom's diagnosis. it's a truly difficult position to be in.

1. consult with a medical professional: first, you need to enlist the help of her healthcare providers. they are the best people to explain to her the dangers of alternative therapies, particularly those that are not scientifically proven. arrange for your mom to meet her doctor and ask if he/she can discuss the potential side effects and risks of the substances she wishes to use. if she doesn't trust her doctor, seek the opinion of another medical professional she might trust.

2. contact a counselor/psychologist: in most cancer hospitals, they have counselors or psychologists who can really help in such situations. they can facilitate discussions between you, your mom, and the doctor and can help address emotions and beliefs that are complicating the treatment process.

3. acquire factual information: knowledge is power. read more about her condition as well as the non-traditional treatments she wants to try. this helps you have an informed but calm discussion with her about the dangers. encourage her to do the same, preferably with reliable sources recommended by healthcare providers. the american cancer society has good resources on alternative treatments that are safe and those that are not.

4. empathy and respect: it is critical that she does not feel attacked or like she's being told what to do. approach these conversations with an understanding tone. highlight that you are worried for her wellbeing. after all, she might be holding onto these alternative therapies as a means of control and hope in a very daunting situation.

5. consider compromise: if she is adamant about trying natural methods, consider looking into safe and effective complementary therapies that could work alongside her medical treatment, such as acupuncture, yoga, massage, meditation, etc. these are known to reduce the stress and symptoms of cancer and its treatment.

6. support groups: hearing from others who are going through the same journey can significantly help. local or online breast cancer support groups can provide her with insight from people who have successfully undergone treatment.

lastly, in a situation where she still decides to go ahead, selling her on the concept of trying both the doctor's way and her way might be a last-ditch option. it's a difficult situation to be in and my heart goes out to you. wishing you strength and resilience through this."
N31,response_19,"i'm really sorry to hear about your mom's diagnosis. it must be an incredibly difficult and stressful time for both of you. your mom is likely looking for control in a situation that feels out of her control, which might explain her exploration of alternative therapies. it's important to approach her with empathy, but it doesn't make your predicament any less challenging. 

convincing someone to change their beliefs can be extremely challenging, but there are some strategies that might work. 

1. **consult with the doctor**: she may not trust everything her doctor says, but hearing about the potential risks of these alternative substances from a professional might make her reconsider. you could arrange a joint appointment where these concerns can be openly discussed.
2. **provide her with reliable information**: there are multiple reliable sources indicating that substances like black salve and mms are not safe for consumption and can be harmful. the american cancer society, mayo clinic, and other reputable organizations have articles discussing the potential dangers. print these out and share them with her.
3. **therapy and counseling**: it could be beneficial to have her speak with a counselor or therapist who specializes in treating cancer patients. they're trained to deal with this type of fear and resistance, and may be able to provide her with coping mechanisms and alternate ways of feeling control over her situation.
4. **support groups**: sometimes hearing other people's stories and sharing experiences can provide a fresh perspective. there are many support group resources available, both locally and online, for both you and your mom. it could help her feel less isolated and more understood.
5. **involve other family members or close friends**: if there are others who she trusts and respects, they might be able to help persuade her. they should approach her gently and non-judgmentally to discuss the potential risks of these substances.

remember, caring for yourself is equally essential during this time. seek support for your emotional well-being, so you are better equipped to care for your mom. the situation is tough, but your love and concern for her well-being are evident. stay strong, and good luck."
N31,response_20,"i'm really sorry to hear about everything you're going through. cancer is a difficult news for anyone to process, and your mum may be leaning towards these alternative treatments as a way to regain some control over her situation.

here are some ideas that might be helpful for you:

1) involve her friends and other trusted individuals: if your mom has a close friend or religious leader she respects, they could help convey the dangers and potential risks of these alternative methods. 

2) encourage her to speak to her doctor: communication with the medical team is important so hope she speaks honestly with them about her concerns and what she is thinking of doing. they are the most qualified to explain to her the implications of her choices, as well as debunk any myths she may have heard.

3) find a support group: connecting with other cancer patients might give her more clarity and perspective, and perhaps learn from others' experiences.

4) reach out to a social worker or psychologist: if feasible, a professional could help her work through her fears and resistance towards conventional treatment.

5) research: if she's into natural treatments, try steering her towards evidence-based options, such as meditation, yoga, healthy eating or anything that can work alongside her current treatment. reaching out to reputable cancer organizations could also provide resources and reliable, science-backed information to counter the pseudoscience ones she is receiving.

i understand you're concerned and it's very stressful. unfortunately, you cannot force her to accept her treatment but helping her feel more informed, heard and supported might influence her decision making. i really hope your mom gets the right treatment she needs and wish you both lots of strength moving forward."
N31,response_21,"i'm very sorry to hear about your mom's situation. it's stressful to deal with a loved one's health crisis, especially when they're making choices you strongly disagree with.

1. direct communication: continue direct conversations with her and make it clear that you're concerned about her health and safety. try to use ""i"" statements rather than ""you"" statements. instead of ""you should not use these dangerous substances,"" say something like, ""i'm worried and scared because using these substances can cause harm to your health.""

2. education: learn more about what she's reading and be prepared to counter it with facts- find supporting articles from trusted medical sources or scholarly types of information. you'll likely be more persuasive if you genuinely understand her perspective and can explain why the alternative methods she's interested in are harmful.

3. medical support: let her physicians know what she's considering and ask them to discuss the risks with her. they may be able to influence her in ways you can't and offer safer alternatives.

4. therapy: encourage her to speak to a psychologist, counselor or social worker specialized in oncology. they can help her process her feelings about her illness and the treatment plan, and potentially help guide her towards safer treatment options.

5. family and friends: seek the assistance of trusted family members and friends. they might be able to help convince her to stop using these substances, especially if they have a medical background.

6. expand her support system: encourage her to join a support group of other cancer patients. they may be able to share their experiences with traditional treatments that may ease her fears.

remember to take care of your own mental and emotional health throughout this challenging time and consider speaking to a counselor or therapist yourself. often medical facilities will have resources available for family members as well. remember you're not alone and there are resources out there to help guide you through this difficult situation."
N31,response_22,"i'm really sorry to hear about your mom's diagnosis and it must be incredibly difficult for both of you during this time. it's understandable that her desperation to regain health would lead her towards unconventional treatments. however, it's also understood that substances like sodium chlorite and topical products like black salve can lead to serious harm especially if not prescribed and supervised by a medical professional. 

here's a few things you can do:

1. **speak to your doctor about it**: perhaps have a conversation about this with her doctor and ask him to emphasize the importance of sticking with proven treatments. medical professionals have more authority and knowledge in this regard and she might be inclined to listen more to them.

2. **counseling and support groups**: having her speak to a counsellor or a cancer support group can be extremely beneficial. they can provide her with emotional support and also help her understand the importance of following prescribed treatments. 

3. **education**: continue to educate her on the harms that these substances can cause. print out research articles, testimonials and anything else that provides more information about their harmful effects.

4. **involve family and friends**: she may be more open to listening if she hears consistent advice from multiple loved ones.

5. **consider involving a therapist**: a mental health professional might be able to help your mom cope better with the fears and anxieties that come with such a diagnosis, and can work with her on trusting the medical professionals handling her treatment.

6. **complementary therapies**: look into complementary therapies that could go along with her current treatment plan. this are non-medical treatments that are used alongside conventional treatment which might satisfy her need for natural treatments.

remember, it's important to approach this with patience and empathy. it might take a while for her to understand the seriousness of these actions but with persistent efforts there's a chance she will."
N31,response_23,"i'm sorry to hear about your mom's diagnosis and i can understand that it's adding extra worry and stress for you to see her drawn towards such risky alternative treatments. you're rightfully concerned as both black salve and mms have many reported dangers associated with their use. 

1. take her to the doctor: if your doctor is aware that she wants to pursue 'natural' treatments, they might be able to recommend a safer solution. they can also explain the severity of these substances she is looking to use.

2. show her testimonials from people who have been hurt by these methods: getting her in contact with individuals or showing her accounts of people who have had negative experiences with these methods could potentially change her mind. 

3. seek the advice of a medical professional: in terms of the medical side of things, i think reaching out to hospitals/health institutions and speaking with professionals who are trained specifically in the treatment and/or care of cancer patients could be beneficial.

4. set boundaries: you may need to set boundaries for your own financial protection, like not sharing your paypal password, especially if it's being used to purchase dangerous substances that could bring harm to her.

5. group intervention: gather some significant family members or her close friends and try a group intervention. the confrontation of many caring individuals and their concerns sometimes can make a person question their own judgment.

lastly, for your own well-being, consider seeking support for yourself. talk to a trusted friend, seek out a support group for family members of cancer patients, or consider talking with a counselor. you're dealing with a tremendous amount of stress, and it's important to take care of your own emotional health, too."
N31,response_24,"firstly, i'm really sorry to hear about your mom's diagnosis. it must be incredibly tough for both of you right now. the fear and uncertainty can be overwhelming, and sometimes people reach out for alternatives in the hope of finding a miracle cure.

convincing people about the dangers of these kinds of ailments can be challenging, especially when they are desperate for solutions, but there are some steps you can take:

1. seek professional help: try having her speak with an oncologist, a doctor specialized in diagnosing and treating cancer. they can explain why these alternative treatments are not only ineffective but also harmful. it might be a good idea to try and find testimonials or stories from other cancer patients who have tried these alternative treatments and have had negative experiences as well.

2. learn about the treatment: having a greater understanding of her current treatment plan could help her feel more in control and trusting of it. the more she knows about the medication and treatment she is receiving, the less likely she may be to pursue dangerous alternatives.

3. encourage her to join a support group: meeting other people who are facing the same illness can be very comforting. there she can learn from their experiences and struggles. this could also discourage her from following dangerous alternative methods.

4. show her real cases: sometimes pictures of harm done by such substances might not be convincing. but real-life experiences and stories from those who have suffered because of using these might make her reconsider her choices.

5. compassion approach: no matter what, approach her with compassion. come from a place of genuine concern about her. this can indicate a profound level of care and can possibly sway her opinions about these substances.

hope you find these suggestions helpful. all the best to you and your mom during this difficult time."
N31,response_25,"i'm sorry to hear you're going through this, it's hard to see someone you love dealing with something so tough, and to see them take such dangerous risks compounds the stress. here's a few suggestions:

1. involve her oncologist: have a frank conversation with her doctor about your concerns and ask them to speak to your mom. sometimes the gravity of these issues tends to sink deeper when explained by a medical professional. if possible, accompany her to her appointments so that you can ensure she’s getting accurate information about her treatment options and risks.

2. find support groups: connect her with cancer support groups where she can share her feelings and hear about others’ experiences. it does a world of difference when she talks to people who are going through the exact same thing. they may also help in dissuading her from trying such risky treatment methods.

3. education: give her books, documentaries or videos about real-life experiences of cancer patients who took the conventional therapy route. 

4. if she is adamant about going the 'natural' route, suggest compromising solutions. suggest that while she continues with her medical treatment, she can also focus on eating a balanced, nutritious diet or try yoga and meditation, which are much safer ways to deal with the stress of cancer than the substances she's looking into. 

5. if she's struggling with the side effects of her medications, don't just let it go. talk to her doctors to help manage them. if she's in physical discomfort from her treatment, that may be part of why she's turning to these ""miracle cures"" out of desperation.

6. counseling could be helpful too. a psychiatrist or therapist who specializes in cancer patients may provide a great resource for helping your mom deal with her fears and anxieties about her disease.

ultimately, stay patient but firm in communicating the risks of these substances. you're doing the best you can do in a tough situation, and your mom is fortunate to have you in her corner."
