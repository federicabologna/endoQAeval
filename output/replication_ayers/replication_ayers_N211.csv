N211,response_1,"the symptoms you're experiencing can be signs of multiple conditions, not just stroke or tia. it's important to note that you're doing the right thing by performing the fast test, because it rules out the possibility of an acute stroke quite effectively. 

however, the intermittent tingling and numbness in your face, arm, and leg could be related to other neurological conditions like multiple sclerosis, migraines, or even some types of epilepsy. it can also be a sign of peripheral neuropathy which can be caused by a number of conditions, including vitamin deficiencies, diabetes, and more. the pressure in your head and dizziness could possibly be linked to migraines or other types of headaches, or conditions like meniere's disease. 

discuss these symptoms thoroughly with your neurologist. it might be useful to keep a symptom diary, noting the time, date, duration, and any relevant factors (like what you were doing or eating) when these episodes occur. this will help your doctor determine the best course of action. 

remember, early detection and treatment are the best ways to manage any neurological condition, so keeping up with your appointments, tests, and any prescribed therapies are essential. 

keep in mind this advice is intended to be general in nature, and specific causes may not apply to your situation. always consult with your healthcare provider about your symptoms."
N211,response_2,"i'm an ai, not a doctor, but based on the information you've given, it's hard to determine exactly what's going on. your symptoms could potentially indicate a neurological issue, but without proper assessment, it's hard to define the exact cause. the symptoms you're describing could potentially be linked to conditions like ms or migraines, but it could also be anxiety or a different issue altogether. it's a good thing you're already under the care of a neurologist. please present these new symptoms to them as soon as possible."
N211,response_3,"i'm an ai language model, not a doctor, but i can provide some general information. it's good that you're aware of the ""fast"" test to check for stroke symptoms: facial drooping, arm weakness, speech difficulties, and the timing of when the symptoms started. however, that test does not rule out all possibility of strokes or transient ischemic attacks (tias), also called mini-strokes. 

your symptoms could potentially indicate a myriad of conditions, including migraines, cervical spine issues, multiple sclerosis, or even anxiety. it could also be related to your other neurological conditions.

it's important that you report these symptoms to your neurologist right away - even before your vng and ecog tests - as they might want to give you a more expedited evaluation. this may include an mri or ct scan to rule out possibilities like strokes.

please note that this advice is intended to be general in nature, and specific causes may not apply to your situation. always consult with your healthcare provider for appropriate examinations, treatment, testing, and care recommendations."
N211,response_4,"i'm an ai developed by openai, not a doctor, but i can tell you that the symptoms you described can be related to various conditions, which may involve the nervous system, circulatory system, or even be a result of stress or anxiety. it's important to share these new symptoms with your neurologist. 

while your age and non-smoking status make it less likely that you're experiencing strokes or tias, it's not impossible. strokes usually cause sudden and significant symptoms that do not improve in a short time, whilst tias (transient ischemic attacks, commonly referred to as ""mini-strokes"") could potentially cause the sensations you're experiencing. remember to note down when these episodes occur, how long they last, and any other symptoms that might occur at the same time (like dizziness or vision changes) to provide your doctor with accurate information.

other conditions that might potentially cause similar symptoms include multiple sclerosis, bell's palsy, anxiety, migraines, or various forms of neuropathy. 

while the fast test you described is a useful first-step tool to check for some of the classic signs of stroke (facial drooping, arm weakness, speech difficulties, and time to call emergency services), it is not comprehensive. if you continue to experience these symptoms, especially if they become more frequent or severe, you should seek immediate medical attention, especially since you're already facing other neurological symptoms."
N211,response_5,"i'm an ai language model and not a doctor, but i can tell you that the symptoms you're describing, while they could indicate a variety of conditions, are not typically associated with strokes or tias (transient ischemic attacks). the symptoms of those conditions are usually much more acute and severe, like sudden weakness or paralysis on one side of the body, trouble speaking or understanding speech, severe headache, and loss of vision or double vision. 

however, your condition could be related to your pre-existing neurological issues. it could also be due to issues with nerve compression, circulation, or a number of other possibilities. 

it's always a good idea to notify your healthcare provider about new or worsened symptoms like the ones you're experiencing so that they can help determine the cause and provide appropriate treatment if necessary."
N211,response_6,"i'm an ai language model, not a doctor, but i'll try my best to provide some insight based on what these symptoms could potentially indicate. the sudden feeling of numbness or weakness in your face, arm, or leg on one side of your body can be a symptom of a stroke. however, you're still able to pass the fast test which is a good sign. it could also be that these sensations are related to your pre-existing and diagnosed neurological conditions. due to the complexity of these symptoms and your pre-existing conditions, direct and prompt medical attention is required to determine the cause. please discuss this with your healthcare provider as soon as possible to rule out more serious conditions like a stroke. don't delay medical attention due to lab backlogs or any other reason."
N211,response_7,"i'm an ai and not a doctor, but it is important to communicate these symptoms you're experiencing to your neurologist or healthcare provider as soon as possible. while unexplained pain and numbness can be caused by many things, in some cases they could indicate serious issues such as stroke or transient ischemic attacks (tia). however, your age and being a non-smoker make it less likely. the ability to pass the fast test is a good sign, but that doesn't necessarily rule out all neurological issues. other possibilities could include migraine, stress, cardiovascular issues, and neurological disorders. please reach out to a healthcare professional right away to discuss your symptoms."
N211,response_8,"it's good to hear that you take immediate action and do the fast test on yourself. it's impossible to tell for sure without testing, but your symptoms could potentially point toward a neurological condition. strokes, mini-strokes, or tias generally come with a sudden onset of symptoms and last more than a few minutes. the numbness and tingling that you're experiencing could be caused by a variety of things, including anxiety, migraines, multiple sclerosis, or even vitamin deficiencies. it is important that you keep a record of your symptoms and that you follow up with your neurologist for further evaluation. they are best equipped to determine if this might be something more serious.
please consult with your treating doctor or healthcare provider and don't rely on this information as advice for a specific medical condition. stay strong and healthy!"
N211,response_9,"numbness or tingling sensations on one side of your body could be a sign of a transient ischemic attack (tia) or mini-stroke, especially if associated with other symptoms such as difficulty with speech or smile. however, your age and the transient nature of your symptoms, recurring several times rather than a single episode, make it less likely to represent a stroke or tia. rather, they could be related to migraines, stress, anxiety, or other neurological conditions already considered. 

however, given the seriousness of a potential stroke and the fact that you are already dealing with neurological issues, i would strongly advise you discuss these symptoms with your healthcare provider as soon as you can. it's also crucial for you to get the testing recommended by your doctors to get to the bottom of your symptoms. 

please note that my advice should not replace consultation with a healthcare provider, and any new, severe, or worsening symptoms, such as sudden numbness, slurred speech, weakness on one side of the body, or severe headache should prompt immediate attention by calling for emergency services (911 or your local emergency contact number)."
N211,response_10,"i'm an ai language model, i can't diagnose conditions or provide medical advice, but i could help you understand some possible causes. it's good to know that you are already in touch with healthcare professionals, who will be able to examine you and make reliable diagnoses. 

unilateral numbness or tingling is not typically a sign of stroke when it's transient and followed by complete recovery, especially in younger individuals and those without typical stroke risk factors like high blood pressure, diabetes, smoking or high cholesterol. transient ischemic attacks (tia or ""mini-strokes"") usually cause more significant symptoms like drooping of the face, weakness in an arm or leg, difficulty speaking, or vision changes, and the symptoms typically last at least several minutes, if not longer.

other things that might cause these symptoms are migraines, certain types of seizures, hyperventilation or anxiety, and various peripheral nerve disorders. neurological conditions like ms could also cause symptoms like these, but it's quite rare for these conditions to start with transient numbness. 

it's encouraging that you are in touch with a neurologist who will no doubt explore these possibilities. it's important to keep them informed about these new symptoms, so they can guide the investigations appropriately."
N211,response_11,"i'm an ai language model and while i can provide some general advice based on common medical knowledge, i strongly recommend that you consult with a healthcare professional who can properly evaluate your condition. 

the symptoms you've mentioned may potentially indicate a neurological condition. although strokes, mini-strokes, or tias (transient ischemic attacks) could cause similar symptoms, your age and the absence of known risk factors (like smoking, uncontrolled high blood pressure, or diabetes) make it less likely. still, a stroke at any age is serious, so medical evaluation is necessary if you're experiencing these symptoms.

as you mentioned, you're already in contact with a neurologist and are scheduled for further tests. this could help find out what's causing your symptoms. other possible causes for such symptoms can include migraines and stress, or different types of neuropathies or other neurological disorders.

in the meantime, make a note of your symptoms, their frequency, and any potential triggers. this data could be useful to your doctors. moreover, if the symptoms intensify or if you experience sudden severe headache, difficulty speaking, difficulty seeing in one or both eyes, or a sudden loss of balance or coordination, seek immediate medical attention. these could be signs of a more serious neurological event, such as a stroke."
N211,response_12,"i'm an ai and not a doctor, but i can tell you that transient ischemic attacks (tias), mini-strokes, and strokes can cause numbness or weakness in your face, arm, or leg, especially on one side of your body, among other symptoms. however, these events are usually associated with risk factors like old age, high blood pressure, smoking, diabetes, and others. they are less common in young healthy people. since you're 23, usually these causes would seem less likely. however, various neurological conditions can also cause similar symptoms. maybe your symptoms are related to your current neurological condition. but since you're experiencing new symptoms, it's crucial to discuss them with your doctors. they can recommend whether or not urgent evaluation is necessary, and help identify the cause behind your symptoms."
N211,response_13,"i'm an ai language model and not a doctor, but i can provide some general insight. while stroke and mini-stroke (transient ischemic attack, or tia) indeed involve symptoms like tingly or numb sensation and these usually occur on one side of the body, these generally won't go away in seconds - they usually last longer, up to several hours. and they usually also involve other severe symptoms like sudden confusion, trouble speaking or understanding speech, trouble seeing in one or both eyes, difficulty walking, loss of balance or coordination, or sudden severe headache. 

as for your tingling/numbness symptoms, they could be tied to several different conditions - stress and anxiety, neurological disorders, migraines, and certain types of deficiencies are all potential causes for these symptoms. 

given that you're already experiencing neurological symptoms, it's important to discuss these new occurrences with your neurologist. they could be related to your ongoing issues, or be indicative of a new problem. always seek advice from a healthcare professional when experiencing new or worsening symptoms."
N211,response_14,"i'm an ai language model and i can't diagnose medical conditions, but i can share that the symptoms you describe could potentially be related to various neurological conditions. tingling and numbness (paresthesias) can be caused by many factors such as migraines, nerve-related conditions, anxiety, multiple sclerosis, or less commonly, transient ischemic attacks (tias) or mini-strokes. however, in younger people without typical risk factors (like high blood pressure, diabetes, smoking, high cholesterol), strokes and tias are less common.

keep in mind, these are just possibilities. the dizziness/vertigo, internal shaking, and head pressure could also hint at other neurological conditions, but it would be inappropriate to speculate without a proper examination and medical history. it's wise to share these symptoms with your neurologist, if you haven't already. consider telemedicine if in-person visits are difficult. 

again, this information doesn't replace professional medical advice. make sure you keep up with your scheduled diagnostic tests and follow up with your doctor regarding these symptoms."
N211,response_15,"i'm an ai language model and not a doctor, but i can share some general information about these symptoms. tingling or numbness in the face, arm, or leg, especially on one side of the body, can sometimes be associated with neurological conditions such as stroke. however, given your age and non-smoking status, the risk of stroke is generally lower. 

it's important to note that there could be other explanations for these symptoms too, such as a pinched nerve, anxiety, or vitamin deficiencies, among others. also, since you mention having other neurological symptoms, these sensations could potentially be linked to those conditions.

ultimately, it's difficult to make a diagnosis without a full clinical evaluation. i strongly recommend you discussing these symptoms with your neurologist or healthcare provider as soon as you can, especially since these symptoms are new. your health care provider will be able to evaluate you and recommend appropriate tests. please don't delay seeking medical help even if there is a backlog due to the pandemic."
N211,response_16,"i'm an ai developed by openai, i'm not a doctor, but from the symptoms you described, it's possible you might be experiencing transient ischemic attacks (tias) or ""mini-strokes"", or other neurologic conditions. the symptoms of a tia can indeed include sudden numbness or weakness in the face or limbs, often affecting just one side of the body. however, these symptoms would typically last longer than a few seconds - typically from a few minutes to a few hours. 

moreover, you're quite young and your other neurologic symptoms might suggest other disorders, such as migraines or multiple sclerosis, both of which can also cause facial numbness. anxiety, stress, mineral deficiencies or other systemic disorders should also be considered. 

however, all these conditions require proper evaluation and testing. you should discuss these symptoms with your neurologist as soon as possible. do not delay seeking medical help, especially if you're worried about having had a tia - early action can significantly reduce the risk of a subsequent, potentially larger stroke. 

remember, this is only a suggestion based on common conditions and should not be used as a definitive diagnosis. only a medical professional can provide you with a proper diagnosis."
N211,response_17,"i'm an ai developed by openai, so i can't diagnose or give professional medical advice. however, i can tell you that the symptoms you're describing could potentially be associated with a variety of neurological conditions, so it's very important to discuss them with your healthcare provider. 

it would be unusual for a stroke or a transient ischemic attack (tia) to cause symptoms that come and go. more commonly, stroke symptoms begin suddenly and do not improve on their own. a tia (""mini-stroke"") can produce temporary symptoms, but these usually last for a few minutes to a few hours, rather than a few seconds as you're describing.

there could be many possible causes for your symptoms – it could be something as simple as a pinched nerve, but given your other neurological symptoms it could also be something more serious. you should definitely reach out to your healthcare provider as soon as possible."
N211,response_18,"i'm an ai language model and not a doctor, but i can tell you that the symptoms you're experiencing could be associated with a variety of conditions, and not necessarily a stroke or a transient ischemic attack (tia).

you're young and you don't smoke, which are both factors that significantly lower your risk of stroke. that being said, it's essential that you discuss these symptoms with your healthcare provider / neurologist. they could be related to your existing neurological conditions, or perhaps to anxiety or stress. you might also want to consider other possibilities such as multiple sclerosis (ms), migraines, or neuropathy. 

however, these are just possibilities, and only a healthcare provider can give you an accurate diagnosis. they will likely need to conduct further testing (like an mri or a ct scan) to get a better understanding of what's going on. 

if these symptoms continue to persist or worsen, make sure to seek urgent medical attention. even though they might not indicate a stroke, they're not normal and should be evaluated promptly. lastly, remember to mention all of these symptoms to your neurologist ahead of your tests as it may affect their approach."
N211,response_19,"i'm an ai language model, not a doctor, but i can share some general information about your symptoms. facial numbness or tingling and numbness in others parts of the body can point to various neurological conditions, from migraines to multiple sclerosis.

a tia or 'mini stroke' often results in sudden and severe symptoms, which may include paralysis or numbness on one side of the body, difficulty speaking, dizziness and vision problems. these symptoms usually last less than 24 hours. while you said you've not had these severe symptoms, it's still a good idea to report any new symptoms to your healthcare provider.

additionally, frustration and anxiety associated with ongoing undiagnosed symptoms can cause a phenomenon called somatization, where mental factors cause physical symptoms. 

again, please talk to your doctor about your symptoms. only they can provide you with a definitive diagnosis. please seek urgent medical assistance if your symptoms become severe or rapidly worsening."
N211,response_20,"you should report these symptoms to your healthcare provider right away, as they could indicate a serious condition. symptoms such as weakness or numbness on one side of the body, occasionally with facial droop and speech difficulties, can be signs of a transient ischemic attack (tia), also known as a mini-stroke. however, these symptoms can also be indicative of other neurological conditions. 

given your ongoing neurological issues, it's possible these symptoms are related but it's difficult to say without further testing. it's encouraging that you've been able to pass the fast test each time, but the recurring nature of these symptoms and the fact they affect multiple parts of your body still warrants medical attention.

because of your young age and non-smoking status, you're not at high risk for a stroke, but stroke can happen at any age and the risk is increased if you have certain medical conditions, such as high blood pressure or heart disease. i would report these new symptoms to your healthcare provider right away and seek emergency medical attention if you experience any severe or sudden symptoms."
N211,response_21,"i'm an ai language model and not a doctor, but i can tell you that strokes and transient ischemic attacks (tias) usually involve more severe and sudden symptoms, like severe headache, trouble walking, difficulty talking, paralysis, severe dizziness, etc. the signs you've described don't match the standard stroke warning signs and symptoms.

however, everyone is different and this does not mean these symptoms should be dismissed. these symptoms can suggest other neurological conditions, like multiple sclerosis, or could potentially be related to anxiety or stress. 

it's encouraging that you're under the care of an ent and neurologist. make sure you update them on these new symptoms. they may want to do further tests and imaging to rule out other conditions. as always, in case of emergency or if symptoms worsen, seek immediate medical attention."
N211,response_22,"i'm an ai developed by openai and i'm not a doctor, but i can provide some general advice based on the information you've provided. 

tia (transient ischemic attack) can sometimes present with fleeting symptoms that resolve fully within a few minutes. however, tias are less common in someone your age and are usually related to risk factors like smoking, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, or a family history of stroke or heart disease.

the numbness and tingling you are experiencing could be due to a number of different issues, including migraines, certain medications, vitamin deficiencies, anxiety, or other neurological conditions. the fact that you're dealing with other neurological sensations like dizziness/vertigo, internal shaking, and head pressure certainly highlights the need for further evaluation. 

the most important step here is to continue discussing these symptoms with your physicians (your neurologist especially), as they can help determine the cause and manage your treatment. however, if you ever start having sudden severe chronic headaches, loss of balance, difficulty speaking or understanding speech, or paralysis or numbness of the face or limbs, you should seek medical attention immediately.

it's great that you're being proactive and are scheduled to have some tests done! this should provide more clarity about your symptoms."
N211,response_23,"i'm an ai developed by openai and i'm not a doctor, but i can give you general advice based on what is typically suggested. 

unusual sensations like numbness or tingling on one side of the body or face can indeed be symptoms of a stroke or tia (transient ischemic attack, often called a ""mini-stroke""). however, these symptoms often come along with others, like sudden confusion, difficulty speaking, trouble seeing, or severe headache. since you're young, a non-smoker, and are currently dealing with other neurological conditions, it's also possible these symptoms could be related to your existing issues. 

if you've been experiencing new symptoms like this, especially if they're occurring repeatedly, it's very important that you reach out to your healthcare provider as soon as possible. even though you haven't yet had your upcoming tests, your provider should still be made aware of these changes so they can help determine what's causing them. they may want to rule out certain serious conditions immediately or modify your upcoming tests.

please don't delay in contacting a health care professional. 

remember that fast (face drooping, arm weakness, speech difficulty, time to call emergency services) is a good general guideline for checking yourself for stroke symptoms - but if you're experiencing other symptoms, that doesn't necessarily mean you're not having a stroke or tia."
N211,response_24,"i'm an ai model developed by openai, so i can provide some general information on this topic. however, this should not replace a thorough evaluation from your healthcare provider. 

the symptoms you're describing - transient tingling or numbness - might be indicative of a transient ischemic attack (tia) or ""mini-stroke"", but they can also occur due to various other conditions such as migraines, seizures, multiple sclerosis, or certain vitamin deficiencies. 

a tia is usually characterized by sudden weakness, numbness, or paralysis on one side of the body, difficulty speaking or understanding speech, dizziness, or sudden loss of balance or coordination. these symptoms are typically very brief, often lasting less than an hour, but they require urgent medical attention regardless.

in your case, a definitive diagnosis can only be provided by a healthcare professional, as this potentially involves other parts of your medical history and may require imaging studies. 

given that you're dealing with other neurological issues and you've noticed new, concerning symptoms, please reach out to your healthcare provider promptly. it's important to keep them informed so they can give accurate advice based on their medical knowledge of your condition."
N211,response_25,"i'm an ai and can't provide a diagnosis, but i can tell you that these symptoms might indicate a neurological condition. both strokes and transient ischemic attacks (tias, or mini-strokes) could theoretically cause the symptoms you've described. other possibilities could include conditions like multiple sclerosis or peripheral neuropathy. however, it's also important to remember that stress and anxiety can sometimes cause similar symptoms. given your current neurological concerns, it's crucial to discuss these new symptoms with your neurologist as soon as possible. please seek immediate medical attention if these symptoms worsen, become persistent, or if you experience other issues such as confusion, difficulty speaking, severe headache, or loss of coordination."
