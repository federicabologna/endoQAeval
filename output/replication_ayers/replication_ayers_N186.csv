N186,response_1,"i'm an ai language model and while i'm not a doctor, the symptoms you've described might be associated with a medical condition called anosmia, which is the inability to perceive odour. there might be several underlying causes for this condition, including longstanding tobacco usages, past viral infections, chronic sinusitis, trauma to the head, certain medications, or rare cases of neurodegenerative diseases.

a detailed examination of your nose, sinus, and brain imaging scans (like ct or mri) might be required to identify the root cause. you mentioned symptoms of taste disturbances, and this could be related to the loss of smell, as both these senses are closely related. i would suggest that you should seek a second opinion from a trained specialist, perhaps a neurologist, who could look into other potential causes of your symptoms, including neurological ones. an ent specialist could also provide additional insights.

important note: this advice is intended to be general in nature, and specific causes may not apply to your situation. always seek the advice of your physician or other qualified health provider with any questions you may have regarding a medical condition."
N186,response_2,"i'm sorry to hear about your struggles. i want to remind you that i am an ai language model and cannot provide medical advice but i can provide you with general suggestions which you might find helpful. it's important for you to consult with health professionals for the best course of action given your unique situation.

- try a different specialist: consider consulting with a neurologist. loss of smell and taste can be a neurological issue as these senses are closely linked to the nervous system.
- get more tests: if you haven't already, consider getting a thorough neurologic examination and possibly brain imaging to rule out any brain-related causes.
- consider consulting an ent: an ear, nose, and throat (ent) specialist might provide useful insights given you mentioned possible sinusitis. you could also consider speaking with an allergist. 
- lifestyle changes: you could also work on lifestyle changes such as quitting smoking, which can directly impact your sense of smell. 
- don't panic: although it's a difficult situation, try to stay calm. the human body has amazing recovery abilities. 

this information is general in nature, and it's very important you consult a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and treatment."
N186,response_3,"i'm an artificial intelligence and i can't diagnose diseases or interpret test results, but i can tell you that some possible causes for losing the sense of smell (anosmia) could include aging, nasal polyps, sinusitis, smoking, injuries to the nose or head, hormonal disturbances, nervous system disorders, and certain medications. some degenerative diseases such as alzheimer’s disease, parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis can also lead to loss of smell.

while the loss of smell is often non-reversible, if removal of nasal obstructions such as polyps can occasionally restore the sense of smell. likewise, if medications or smoking are causing anosmia, stopping the offending drugs or quitting smoking may be beneficial.

unfortunately, when the cause of anosmia can't be determined, treatment options become more limited. if a viral infection destroyed the olfactory nerves, these nerves can rarely regenerate.

smell loss from a head injury usually improves within several weeks to a few months. if no improvement is seen, the chance of improvement is lower. smell loss from chronic sinusitis can usually be reversed through treatment. 

talk to your healthcare provider about your concern in losing your taste, they might want to perform further investigations. 

remember that online advice is never a substitute for professional medical advice. you should always consult with a healthcare provider for any health problems."
N186,response_4,"sorry to hear that you're going through this. unfortunately, as an artificial intelligence, i can't offer personal medical advice. however, i can give you some general suggestions based on common reasons for sensory loss. in addition to sinusitis, tobacco usage, and the virus, other potential causes might be polyps in the nasal cavity, certain medications, or neurological conditions. it's crucial to keep following up with doctors and specialists until you have a definitive answer. if you're losing your taste as well, this may indicate a more systemic issue. therefore, you might want to ask about a referral to a neurologist if this hasn't been done already. it's also a good idea to keep notes of all the details as they may be useful in diagnosis. you could even reach out to organizations or support groups that deal with sensory loss for advice and input. but, the best step is to maintain communication with your healthcare provider."
N186,response_5,"i'm an ai developed by openai, and while i can provide some general information, you should speak to a healthcare professional for any serious concerns.

losing your sense of smell (anosmia) over a period of time can be due to a number of reasons including nasal inflammation due to rhinosinusitis, damage to the nasal or brain tissues from injury, exposure to certain chemicals or toxins, and some medications. there are cases where tobacco use could lead to a decrease in sense of smell, but not usually total loss. aging can also cause a slow decline in ability to sense smells.

while it's quite unusual, certain neurological conditions like alzheimer's disease or parkinson's disease can cause anosmia. but those conditions usually present with other symptoms as well.

though some viral infections can cause loss of smell, it's often temporary and typically resolves after the infection has passed. however, this may not be the case if the olfactory nerve (which is responsible for smell) has been significantly damaged.

given that you're also losing your sense of taste, it's even more important to speak to a specialist. loss of taste (ageusia) could be related with loss of smell, as most flavor comes from smell.

your plan to have a consult regarding the possible septal deviation is a good step. a nasal/sinus ct scan can provide a lot of information and help guide management. it might also be beneficial to see a neurologist or a neuro-otologist, as they specialize in diseases of the nervous system and balance organs that could cause these symptoms.

remember: it's important to be persistent. it can be easy to dismiss sensory losses, but this is a significant change, and it’s important to keep pressing for answers in order to rule out any serious underlying conditions."
N186,response_6,"i'm an ai language model and while i'm not a doctor, i can provide some general insights here. a loss of smell and taste can be temporary or permanent, depending on the cause. it's often associated with conditions such as rhinitis, sinusitis, and upper respiratory infections. however, more serious conditions like neurological disorders (including parkinson’s and alzheimer’s diseases) can also lead to these symptoms. 

it is crucial you seek immediate medical attention since you're also losing your sense of taste, the cause of which could be simple or complex. it might be necessary to see a neurologist or an ent specialist for a thorough investigation. you should also look into getting a second opinion if you're not satisfied with your current diagnosis and treatment plan. discuss all your medications with your doctor to rule out any side effects causing these symptoms.

remember, though, this advice is not a substitute for professional medical advice. please ensure you consult qualified healthcare professionals who can understand your condition and guide you accordingly."
N186,response_7,"i'm an ai language model and not a doctor, but i can provide some general advice. losing your senses of smell and taste could be due to a variety of reasons, such as injury to the nose or sensory nerves, long-term smoking, certain medications, neurological disorders, or some viral infections. 

however, gradual loss over several years is unusual and might point towards a chronic condition or progressive disorder. degenerative diseases such as parkinson's or alzheimer's might have such symptoms, though they are usually accompanied by other signs and symptoms, such as memory loss or tremors.

you should get a full medical evaluation to rule out any serious condition. if the doctors you've seen haven't been helpful, you may need to seek a second opinion. look for an ear, nose, and throat specialist (ent) or a neurologist who has experience with smell and taste disorders.

if you're a smoker, try to quit as it has been known to dull the senses of taste and smell. also, long term use of certain medications may affect these senses. seek advice from your doctor if medication is part of your problem.

remember, i'm just an ai and can't replace professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. always seek the advice of your physician or other qualified health provider with any questions you may have regarding a medical condition. don't delay professional medical advice because of something you read here."
N186,response_8,"i'm an ai language model and not a doctor, but i can suggest some general advice. if you're experiencing significant changes like loss of smell and taste, it's crucial to keep seeking medical assistance. it is indeed possible that the cause could be sinusitis, smoking, a viral infection, or a side effect of medication. some neurological conditions can also potentially cause such symptoms. however, diagnosing these conditions requires advanced medical knowledge and appropriate tests. you might want to consider seeking a second opinion, possibly from a neurologist. however, it's important to follow your current doctor's advice until you can get another opinion. the best course of action is to continue communicating with healthcare professionals who can provide you with accurate and personalized advice."
N186,response_9,"i'm an ai and while i can't diagnose or give medical advice, i can share some information.

a loss of smell (anosmia) can be due to various causes, which include nasal polyps, sinusitis, certain viral infections, some medications, neurodegenerative conditions like parkinson's or alzheimer's disease, tobacco use, and exposure to certain chemicals. the fact that you're also losing your sense of taste could maybe suggest a neurological issue as both are closely related, but it might also be the progression of the same unknown cause of your anosmia. 

you should definitely insist for your concerns to be fully investigated by your doctors, as possible causes range from benign and treatable to more serious ones. you might need more tests - this could involve more imaging like mri or seeing a neurologist. 

additionally, it's worth addressing lifestyle changes that could possibly help - if you're a smoker, cessation might improve your symptoms, and staying well-hydrated could also be beneficial. 

don't delay seeking a second opinion for your symptoms. you have every right to be concerned and to want answers for your health issues."
N186,response_10,"i'm really sorry to hear that you've been going through this. while i'm an ai and can't replace a professional diagnosis or advice, let me suggest some questions you might ask your healthcare provider:

1. are there any specialists such as an olfactory specialist or a neurologist that they recommend you visit?
2. can they run a series of blood tests or mris to rule out the possibility of a neurological issue or other underlying conditions?
3. could it be anosmia, a condition which often involves complete loss of smell?
4. can they consider reviewing your medications, if any, to rule out that this is not a side effect?
5. is it possible for you to take a covid-19 test to rule out this as a cause?
6. in the meantime, are there any lifestyle changes or rehabilitative processes you can incorporate to help manage the condition?

remember, it's crucial to seek personalized advice from your healthcare provider or another qualified professional, they have the necessary training to provide comprehensive answers."
N186,response_11,"i'm really sorry to hear that you're going through this. it's very tough to lose a fundamental sense like smell, especially as it connects to our ability to taste. you've seen several doctors and it seems their opinions vary quite a bit. 

unfortunately, i'm an ai and can't answer medical questions, but here are a few suggestions:

1. it may be helpful to find an ent (ear, nose and throat) specialist who has specific knowledge in the areas of smell and taste disorders. such doctors might have more specific insights or suggestions towards what to do next.
2. keep a symptom journal. this can potentially help your doctor better understand the timeline and manner in which your senses have changed.
3. try to be patient with yourself. dealing with a health problem, especially one that could have life-changing impacts, can be very stressful. remember that it's normal to feel worried or uncertain in situations like this, and it's important to take care of your mental health as well.

these are just general suggestions and not intended as specific medical advice. it's critical to consult with healthcare professionals who can provide advice tailored to your specific situation."
N186,response_12,"i'm an ai language model, i'm not a doctor, but i can suggest you some possibilities. you should keep in mind that you need to discuss any health concerns with a medical professional. 

loss of smell, or anosmia, can be caused by various factors, including chronic sinusitis, nasal polyps, certain viral infections, smoking, and exposure to certain chemicals. other, neurological conditions, such as alzheimer's and parkinson's, can also cause anosmia, but these are usually associated with other symptoms too, such as memory loss or motor impairment. 

the loss of taste, or ageusia, might be connected to your loss of smell, as these senses are closely connected. most of what we perceive as taste is actually smell, so losing one can impact the other. 

it's important that you communicate your concerns to your doctor. it might be helpful to seek a second opinion from a specialist, such as an otolaryngologist. consider asking about further testing, such as mri or other imaging, to rule out any other causes. 

remember, this advice is just informational and isn't a substitute for professional medical advice. always consult with a healthcare provider for accurate information."
N186,response_13,"i'm an ai developed by openai, and while i can provide general advice on your situation, i can't provide an accurate medical diagnosis. anosmia (loss of smell) can result from a wide variety of causes, including sinusitis, tobacco use, certain viruses, and even some neurodegenerative diseases.

the gradual decline you're describing, followed by the loss of taste, sounds troubling. if you are losing your sense of taste and smell, this can suggest a condition affecting the nerves involved in these functions. this could be a neurological condition but it could also be due to multiple other reasons such as chronic sinus issues, certain medications, and some conditions like nasal polyps.

but please don't be scared due to these possibilities, you must consult the appropriate healthcare professional to get a proper diagnosis. it would be worth considering a consultation with a neurologist because anosmia and ageusia (loss of taste) can be early indicators for neurological conditions like parkinson's disease or alzheimer's. this doesn't mean that you certainly have these conditions but these are important considerations that need to be ruled out.

lastly, it is not certain that your loss of smell is permanent. some people do experience a recovery or improvement over time. it's also worth noting that recovery can sometimes take years.

it is very important to keep discussing your symptoms and fears with your doctor until you find an answer that satisfies you. also, consider seeking a secondary opinion from another nose and throat specialist or a neurologist about your symptoms."
N186,response_14,"i'm really sorry to hear that you're going through this, it sounds incredibly difficult. while i am an ai and can't diagnose you or give you immediate medical advice, i can tell you that losing your sense of smell (anosmia) and taste (ageusia) can be caused by a variety of factors, it's good to consult with healthcare professionals to explore all possibilities. persistent smoking, sinuses problems, neurological conditions, or medication side effects can cause loss of smell. 
in some cases, it could be an indicator of degenerative diseases like parkinson's or alzheimer's, but these are generally accompanied by other symptoms. since you are also losing your sense of taste, it would be advisable to continue seeking medical attention. given how much these symptoms are impacting your quality of life, exploring further diagnostic procedures is warranted, like neurologist consultation or mri, if your doctors agree.
if you feel your concerns are being overlooked, you might want to seek another opinion. there are also specialist clinics that deal with smell and taste disorders that you could consider. 
remember, it's your health and you are your own best advocate."
N186,response_15,"i'm really sorry to hear about your struggles, but as an ai, i'm not equipped to provide medical advice. it's really important to talk your concerns over with a healthcare provider, who can provide guidance based on a full understanding of your situation and medical history. however, i can provide some general information about anosmia (loss of smell) and how it might relate to other symptoms.

anosmia can be caused by a number of conditions, including sinus infections, nasal polyps, or certain viral infections. in some cases, it may be a side effect of medications. in rare cases, loss of smell can be an early sign of certain neurological disorders like alzheimer's or parkinson's disease. 

taste and smell are closely linked, so if you're experiencing a loss of smell, you might also notice a change in your sense of taste as well.

if you are worried about the cause of your symptoms and feel that it has not been adequately addressed, it might be helpful to seek a second opinion. specialists who might be able to further assist you include neurologists or otolaryngologists (ear, nose, and throat doctors).

it is common to feel anxious and worried in such situations, and seeking support from friends, family, or mental health specialists can be beneficial. your concerns and feelings are valid, and it's important to address your mental health in addition to your physical health. 

remember that every case is unique, and what happens in other people's situations may not necessarily happen in yours. always consult with your healthcare provider for diagnosis, treatment, and answers to your medical questions."
N186,response_16,"i'm not a doctor, but i might be able to provide some general advice. the loss of smell or taste can be linked to various conditions. the three most common reasons are:

1. rhinitis – inflammation of the mucous membrane inside the nose
2. polyps – non-cancerous growth inside the nasal cavity
3. sinusitis – inflammation of the sinuses

degenerative neurological conditions, such as parkinson's disease or alzheimer's, have also been associated with the loss of smell. however, this seems less likely in your case given your age and the fact that you're not mentioning other symptoms related to these conditions.

i believe you must be feeling very anxious right now, which is totally understandable. here are some next steps you can consider:

1. get a second opinion: a different doctor might give another perspective or run additional tests to identify the root cause.
2. speak with an ent specialist: they could provide more insights into the cause of your issues and potential treatment options.
3. ask your doctor about the link to degenerative disease: be open with your worries. they can explain why they believe this isn't the cause or run tests to alleviate your concern.
4. if you're a smoker, consider quitting or reducing the amount you smoke: this could help with both your smell and taste issue and general health.
5. keep a symptom diary: this could be useful in identifying any patterns or triggers.

remember that the sooner an issue is identified the more likely it is that treatment will be effective. it's important that you advocate for your health and not allow your concerns to be dismissed. please keep in mind that this advice is intended to be general in nature, and specific causes may not apply to your circumstances. always consult with a healthcare professional for accurate information."
N186,response_17,"i'm an ai developed by openai, and while i can provide some general advice, please remember that it's essential to seek personalized advice from a healthcare professional.

loss of smell is a condition known as anosmia, and loss of taste is called ageusia. both can result from a wide variety of causes, including nasal congestion from a cold, flu, sinus infection, nasal polyps, or allergies. chronic exposure to certain chemicals, such as insecticides and solvents, and some medications could also be factors.

smoking can also damage your sense of smell, and long-term sinusitis might be a culprit too. ageusia can commonly result from loss of smell because your ability to taste is closely connected to your sense of smell.

in rare situations, neurodegenerative disorders, such as parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, or alzheimer's disease, could potentially cause these symptoms. however, these conditions usually present with other symptoms, like trouble with movement or cognitive problems, before affecting the sense of smell or taste.

your doctors have recommended different things, from prednisolone to a septum deviation surgery. if you're confused about what to do next, i'd recommend asking for a second opinion. 

it's important that you be assertive about your concerns and ask your doctors why they might be ruling out other potential causes. it's your health, and you have a right to understand the logic behind your treatment plan. 

better understanding might also come from being evaluated by a neurologist, who could assess for neurological causes, or an otolaryngologist who specializes in ear, nose, throat, and head and neck disorders.

remember, it's essential to stay in contact with your health professionals even if you're not getting the answers you want right away. it can take time to diagnose conditions related to the senses since many factors could be at play. in any case, you should definitely not neglect your situation, especially now that your taste is also affected."
N186,response_18,"i'm sorry to hear about the difficulties you're experiencing. it's really tough when you can't find the answers you're looking for. i'm an ai developed by openai and while i'm not a doctor, i can share some information that might be helpful. sometimes, loss of smell (called anosmia) can be caused by damage to the olfactory nerve, which doctors usually associate with respiratory infections, head trauma, or sometimes tobacco use. chronic sinusitis is also linked to anosmia. in less common scenarios, neurodegenerative disorders like parkinson's or alzheimer's disease can present a loss of smell as one of the early signs, but typically other noticeable symptoms will occur. given your age and described history, it's more likely that your anosmia is associated with respiratory issues or potentially tobacco use, rather than a neurodegenerative disorder. that said, it's important to get a comprehensive medical evaluation to rule out other causes. it won't be helpful, though, to stress excessively about unlikely scenarios. try to find a healthcare professional who can offer extensive tests and really listen to your concerns. it may also be worth looking into clinics or doctors who specialize in anosmia."
N186,response_19,"i'm an ai language model rather than a doctor, but based on the experiences you've shared, it sounds like you're going through a really tough time. this is indeed a serious issue, as loss of smell and taste can greatly impact your quality of life. 

to potentially recover these senses, you may want to explore causes like nerve damage from a viral infection, sinus issues, or effects of smoking, as your doctors have suggested. other conditions, such as certain neurological disorders or nasal polyps, can also cause a loss of smell and taste. 

it's important to keep working with your healthcare professionals and to express your concerns. you may want to consider asking for a referral to an otolaryngologist (an ear, nose, and throat specialist) if you haven't seen one yet. 

one possible avenue of research to explore with your healthcare provider is olfactory training, which has demonstrated some potential in helping partial recovery of the sense of smell in certain studies. 

please, don't lose hope and stay proactive with your health. however, remember that you need to have a direct conversation with your doctor or a professional healthcare provider regarding your condition."
N186,response_20,"i'm an artificial intelligence and i can't take a complete medical history or examine you, so i can't tell you exactly what's going on, but i can try to give you some general guidance based on the information you've provided.

your symptoms of losing your sense of smell and taste could potentially be attributed to many different causes - from nasal or respiratory infections, sinusitis, regular tobacco usage, or more serious conditions such as neurodegenerative diseases. it seems like your doctors have taken some steps to identify a few possible causes but you are understandably worried they may be missing something.

it sounds like a good next step might be to request a neurological evaluation to rule out any nerve damage or potential degenerative diseases. 

sinusitis and regular tobacco usage are key suspects and can contribute to a dulled or lost sense of smell. the surgery for your deviated septum could potentially improve airflow, which may help with your senses, but again, this isn't a guarantee.

one important thing to note is that the use of prednisolone should be under strict medical supervision as side effects can occur. 

remember, please use this as purely informational in nature and consult with your healthcare provider. your ongoing symptoms are concerning and need thorough investigation. given that previous visits have not yielded a satisfactory explanation, you may also want to consider seeing a different specialist for a second opinion."
N186,response_21,"i'm really sorry to hear that you're going through this. while i am an ai and not a doctor, i can understand your worry and still give some suggestions as to what you can do. 

it's important to remember that while loss of smell and subsequently taste can be associated with degenerative disease, it can also be the result of a seemingly unrelated condition or injury that you might not even remember. 

you might want to pursue more specialized testing, such as an olfactory nerve test, to potentially get a better understanding of your condition's cause. 

one condition causing loss of smell and taste is chronic sinusitis and there are medications and surgeries available that can potentially help in these cases. prednisolone can help combat inflammation in your sinuses to hopefully improve your symptoms.

tobacco use can also impact your sense of smell, though it would be rare for it to cause complete loss of smell.

do not panic, as stress can often exacerbate symptoms and decrease overall quality of life. it would be a good idea to pursue further testing to rule out more severe conditions if that's what you're worried about.

also, you might want to stop smoking as it detrimentally affects your overall health in many ways, not only smell and taste. 

finally, remember that it can take quite a while for your sense of smell or taste to return, especially if the condition causing it in the first place hasn't been adequately treated. try staying positive and continue working with your healthcare provider to find a more definitive diagnosis.

again, consult with a professional healthcare provider."
N186,response_22,"i'm an ai and i'm not a doctor, but i can give you some general advice based on what you've shared. 

loss of smell, or anosmia, can indeed be caused by a number of different factors, as your doctors have suggested. these can range from viral infections and sinusitis, to tobacco use or side effects from certain medications. 

it is also true that long-term or permanent loss of smell can occur if the olfactory nerves have been severely damaged - something that unfortunately cannot be reversed. 

regarding your worries about a degenerative disease - conditions such as alzheimer's or parkinson's can indeed be associated with a loss of sense of smell, but these diseases typically present with other symptoms too (like problems with memory, movement, mood, etc). 

that said, your symptoms clearly worry you a lot, and it sounds like you need a thorough evaluation. i recommend pushing for further investigations. a neurologist could provide a good next step. they may suggest things like mri scans or other tests to better pinpoint the cause of your anosmia. 

please remember this is general advice, and may not apply to your specific situation. contacting your healthcare provider should be the first step."
N186,response_23,"i'm an ai and not a doctor, but i can share some information with you. loss of smell and taste can definitely be alarming. it can be caused by numerous factors, including upper respiratory infection, chronic sinusitis, smoking, certain medications, or neurological conditions. in your case, it does seem like the doctors are considering multiple potential causes, such as the chronic sinusitis and tobacco use, although it might be frustrating if you feel like they're not being thorough enough. it's very important to continue following up with your doctors. keep expressing your concerns and discuss all your symptoms with them. you could consider getting a second opinion from another doctor and discussing the possibility of getting your sense of smell and taste tested. the decrease in your sense of taste could also be due to the loss of your sense of smell as these two senses are connected. remember, this advice is intended to be general in nature, you need to consult with a healthcare provider for proper medical advice."
N186,response_24,"i'm an ai and not a doctor, but i'll try to give you some general advice based on the information you've provided. 

your lose of smell, known medically as anosmia, can be due to variety of reasons. yes, some of the potential causes you mentioned like sinusitis, tobacco use and viral infections can cause anosmia. nutritional deficiencies, head injuries, and some medications can also lead to loss of smell.

with regards to degenerative disease, loss of smell is sometimes seen in certain neurological disorders such as parkinson’s disease and alzheimer’s disease. 

the loss of sense of taste could be related to the loss of smell, as these senses are often linked. however, it could also indicate further health issues, and should be reported to a healthcare professional. 

my advice to you would be to seek further medical attention. get the cat scan if you haven't already, and perhaps consider asking for a referral to a neurologist. they may be able to help determine if there is a neurological cause to your symptoms. 

don’t hesitate to bring up concerns about possible underlying conditions with your doctors. it's important to have all potential causes examined. 

please remember, though, this advice is very general and it's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for your particular case."
N186,response_25,"i'm an ai developed by openai and i'm here to provide general information based on your situation. it seems like you've made significant efforts to consult with doctors and specialists. 

loss of smell (anosmia) can indeed be caused by various factors, like you've pointed out: persistent sinusitis, regular smoking, viral infections, medication side effects, and even more serious conditions such as neurodegenerative diseases. 

loss of taste (ageusia) is often associated with loss of smell, as the two senses are closely connected. if you're also experiencing this symptom, it's even more important to continue to seek medical advice. 

though it must be worrisome and frustrating, especially with delays in care due to the pandemic, keep being proactive about your health.

this is a highly specialized situation that needs professional intervention, so kindly follow up with your healthcare provider. document all your symptoms meticulously, seek a second or third opinion if needed, and ask your medical professionals about next steps and potential causes. at the same time, it's important to manage stress and anxiety which can also affect your overall health.
