N111,response_1,"i'm an ai language model and not a doctor, but i understand that you have concern regarding low pulse rate while having a panic attack. generally, a low pulse is not necessarily indicative of a problem and, in fact, in many cases is a sign of good health. however, during a panic attack, it's more common for the heart rate to increase. in your case, if you aren't experiencing symptoms like lightheadedness or fainting, and your healthcare provider isn't particularly concerned, it's likely nothing overly worrisome. anxiety can manifest in different ways, and it could be your body’s way of coping with the stress. this matter would still be best discussed with a healthcare professional to ensure accuracy and safety."
N111,response_2,"speaking as an ai developed by openai, it sounds like you've been visiting your doctor frequently and have been getting regular check-ups. it's good to see that all your results have come back normal, and that's reassuring. 

resting heart rate can vary greatly among individuals. for adults, a normal resting heart rate is 60-100 beats per minute, although athletes or individuals who are very physically active may have a lower resting heart rate. from what you've shared, it seems like your heart rate increases appropriately with physical activity (like going up a hill), which is what's expected.

anxiety can sometimes cause an increase in heart rate, but not always. everyone's body responds differently to stress and anxiety. it sounds like despite your anxiety, your body doesn't respond by significantly increasing your heart rate or breathing rate. and that's perfectly okay.

a normal spo2 range is typically between 95-100%, so your oxygen levels are completely normal. dyspnea (difficulty breathing) can be a symptom of anxiety, and given that your spo2 is always within the normal range, it's very likely that your feeling of difficulty breathing is not due to a physical heart or lung condition.

gerd and muscle tension could also potentially contribute to your feelings of breathlessness. gerd can cause a sensation of a lump in the throat, or a feeling like it's difficult to breathe. muscle tension can affect the muscles involved in breathing, making it feel like it's hard to draw a full breath.

overall, it sounds like everything is functioning well. however, managing your anxiety effectively could help ease some of your symptoms. cognitive behavioral therapy (cbt) has been shown to be very effective for anxiety, and there are self-management strategies like mindfulness, meditation and deep breathing techniques that could also be helpful. it might be useful to discuss these options with your doctor if you haven't already done so. 

but remember to continue regular check-ups with your healthcare provider, especially if new symptoms develop or if current symptoms worsen."
N111,response_3,"even though you don't work out a lot, the walking you do everyday could indeed be keeping your heart healthy, hence the low pulse rate. heart rate can be slow because of conditions such as sick sinus syndrome or heart block, which can be present without any symptoms, especially in young age. however, since your ecgs have come back as normal, it is less likely that you may have these conditions. 

gerd (gastroesophageal reflux disease) and anxiety can definitely make you feel short of breath, even when your pulse oximeter shows normal spo2. 

during panic attacks, your breathing can feel adversely affected depending on what your body's ""fight-or-flight"" response is. in your case, it's possible that your response leans more towards ""calming down"" instead of ""freaking out"", hence why your heart rate doesn't shoot up or make you hyperventilate.

while your doctor is ultimately the best person to guide you in this, as a general note, if you're anxious about your heart rate, maybe you can try to track it less frequently. since you do not have light-headedness or fainting spells which could be a sign of inadequate blood supply to the brain from a slow heart rate, monitoring your heart rate multiple times a day might not be necessary and could instead contribute to your anxiety. 

remember to breathe deeply and fully during panic attacks, as this will help your body to calm down from the inside. getting psychological support for your anxiety, such as from a psychotherapist or counselor, could be really helpful, too."
N111,response_4,"hello! i'm a medical chatbot here to provide some information. 

firstly, i'm glad to hear that you've had clear ecgs and that your pulse increases appropriately with activity. this is reassuring. also, your o2 saturation and peak flow are normal.

resting heart rates can vary widely among healthy people. a normal resting heart rate for adults ranges from 60 to 100 beats per minute. however, a heart rate below 60 is also normal for some people, especially for athletes, people who are very physically active, or people who are otherwise in good health. 

it sounds like one of your concerns is that your heart rate does not increase when you are having a panic attack. it's interesting, but not necessarily a sign of anything dangerous. the relationship between anxiety and heart rate can be complex, and not everyone will respond the same way. some people might have an increased heart rate with anxiety, while others might not. 

gerd can sometimes cause symptoms that feel like shortness of breath and it can also contribute to anxiety.

muscle tension can also potentially restrict your movements making you feel as though you can't take a deep breath. 

however, it’s always good to continue following up with your doctor about these symptoms, since they know your medical history and can provide personalized advice. i'd also suggest discussing your concerns about your anxiety, as managing this could potentially help with your heart rate concerns and feeling of breathlessness."
N111,response_5,"the symptoms you describe sound anxiety related rather than any heart defect - especially given you have had normal ekg results. it's not uncommon for individuals, especially young adults, to have a lower resting heart rate. resting heart rates can range from 40-60 bpm in athletes (or individuals with great cardiovascular fitness) to 60-100 bpm in most adults.

given that your heart rate rises with activity and your doctor's findings are normal, it seems your heart is functioning as it should be. your symptoms may still very well be anxiety related, and your panic attacks may manifest differently from what you think of as ""typical"" symptoms. you could consider talking to a mental health professional about your anxiety and potential ways to manage it. 

for gerd, changes in diet and lifestyle factors can sometimes help. it's always best to maintain open communication with your doctor and report any changes in your symptoms. remember, this is not professional medical advice, but an informed response based on your description. please seek help from healthcare professionals for any health issues."
N111,response_6,"i'm an ai assistant, and i just want to remind you that while i can give you information, it can't replace professional advice.

with regard to your low pulse rate, barring any undiagnosed heart conditions—which seems unlikely given you've had ecgs—we can consider two things:

1. your low pulse could be due to your level of fitness. while you say you're not super athletic, if you're walking for 1-2 hours a day, that's still a decent amount of regular exercise. a lower resting heart rate indicates more efficient heart function and better cardiovascular fitness.

2. anxiety can sometimes cause a lower-than-normal heartbeat. this is because during a panic attack, you might start to hyperventilate. hyperventilation can lead to decreased oxygen levels in your blood (since you're breathing out too much carbon dioxide), which can then stimulate a reflex that slows your heart rate down.

but remember, everyone's body responds differently to anxiety and stress. some people might have an increased heart rate, while others might have a decreased one.

i agree with your doctor that you should start to worry if you're fainting or feeling dizzy, which would suggest you have a problem with your heart's rhythm or blood flow.

regarding your difficulty breathing associated with anxiety, you may benefit from speaking to your doctor about cognitive behavioral therapy (cbt), meditation techniques, or anti-anxiety medication if these symptoms continue to cause significant distress.

as always, though, you should consult with your doctor if you have any new or concerning symptoms."
N111,response_7,"your heart rate is in the lower end of what is considered normal, but it is still within the normal range (40-100 beats per minute). your heart might be in better condition than you think due to your regular walks. however, i would suggest investigating further in case it is a medical condition like bradyarrhythmia causing your slow heart rate. your gp might want to refer you to a cardiologist for an ekg and/or a holter monitor to make sure your heart rate doesn't drop too low while sleeping. the symptoms you mentioned could be anxiety-related, but it's better to be sure."
N111,response_8,"i'm an ai designed to help with health related queries, but always consider speaking to your doctor regarding any concerns. 

based on the information you've provided, there might be quite a few factors at play here. it's great that your ecgs are fine and you're maintaining a healthy lifestyle by engaging in walks daily. your peak flow readings are within normal range, as is your oxygen saturation.

in general, resting heart rates can range anywhere from 40-100 beats per minute, with rates at the lower end of the spectrum often seen in individuals who are more physically fit. a slow heart rate could also be a result of regular deep breathing exercises, yoga, or certain medications. however, it is worth noting that others simply have a naturally slow heart rate, which is not usually a concern unless other symptoms are present (like passing out, as your doctor has mentioned).

your overall health seems okay based on what you've shared. anxiety can indeed make your heart rate increase, but it's not always true for everyone. our bodies respond differently to stress and anxiety, so a low heart rate during these times isn't unheard of. if the sensation of a slow heartbeat is making you uncomfortable or contributing to your anxiety, it might be helpful to discuss this further with your doctor or a mental health professional.

it's also important to continue managing your gerd and muscle tension, as these conditions can make anxiety worse or physical sensations more noticeable.

lastly, always remember that if you're feeling unsure or need further advice, your healthcare provider should be your first point of contact.
while these opinions might be helpful, they are not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. you should not rely on my message to decide whether to seek or not to seek professional medical advice, and you should contact a healthcare professional immediately if your health condition worsens or does not improve."
N111,response_9,"some people naturally have a lower heart rate. this is often seen in highly fit individuals, but not always. as long as it isn't causing any symptoms (like dizziness, fainting, fatigue) and your ekgs came back normal, it's not usually cause for concern.

anxiety, especially chronic anxiety, can cause a variety of strange physical sensations. one common symptom of anxiety is a feeling of not being able to take a deep breath, or breathlessness, despite normal blood oxygen levels. this can sometimes be interpreted as a low pulse or difficulty breathing. cognitive-behavioral therapy with a therapist who specializes in health-related anxiety could be helpful here. 

if you're not already doing so, i'd highly recommend seeing a therapist so that they can help you manage and cope with your health anxiety. it can make a huge difference, especially seeing one who specializes in cognitive-behavioral therapy. 

regarding diets and weight loss, losing a large amount of weight in a short period of time can stress your body and cause various health problems. a dietitian can help you keep a balanced diet and maintain a healthy weight. 

remember that i'm an ai model trained by doctors and i'm here to provide information, not medical advice. but it sounds like the advice from your doctor to see a cardiologist only if start to pass out is in line with the general approach in cases like yours. be sure to use trusted health professionals when it comes to your health."
N111,response_10,"based on the information you provided, it seems like your slow resting heart rate is due to a good baseline level of fitness from daily walking. it's not uncommon for people who are physically active to have lower resting heart rates. in athletes for instance, it can be as low as 40 beats per minute (bpm). 

the heart is a muscle, and like other muscles, it becomes stronger with exercise. this means it can pump more blood with each beat, and therefore doesn't need to beat as frequently to maintain blood flow. that's why physically active people often have lower heart rates.

in terms of your anxiety, it's important to understand that while many people associate anxiety with a rapid heart rate, a slow heart rate (bradycardia) can also occur during an anxiety attack. this is because the body's response to stress and fear is complex and can involve multiple bodily systems, including the nervous and cardiovascular systems.

however, your doctor is in the best position to understand your individual health situation. if your heart rate is consistently below 60 bpm and you're feeling symptoms such as lightheadedness, shortness of breath, fainting or near fainting, chest discomfort, or confusion, you should let him or her know.

regarding your gerd and difficulty breathing, those could also be contributing to your symptoms and should be appropriately managed too. again, your doctor is the best person to advise on this."
N111,response_11,"hi there. from what you've described, it seems that you have a relatively healthy resting heart rate. it's typical for fit individuals to have a lower resting heart rate, as a heart that's in good shape doesn't need to work as hard, hence the beating slows. 

however, anxiety can cause a wide range of physical responses, and everyone has unique symptoms. some people may have elevated heart rates during panic attacks, while others may not. as strange as it may seem, it could just be how your body handles stress.

it's great news that your doctor says your heart sounds fine. if your symptoms worsen or you're still feeling uneasy, i'd recommend continuing to follow your doctor's advice. 

since your breathlessness isn't associated with low oxygen levels (your spo2 is normal), it might be linked to your anxiety. cognitive-behavioral therapy may well be of benefit to you. 

also, for your gerd, you may want to consider lifestyle modifications such as elevating the head of your bed, eating smaller more frequent meals, avoiding food prior to bedtime, and avoiding certain foods and beverages that trigger symptoms.

of course, i'm an ai assistant and not a doctor, so for all questions or concerns it's always best to consult with your healthcare provider."
N111,response_12,"based on the information you've provided, it seems like your heart rate is within a normal range. a resting heart rate for adults ranges from 60 to 100 beats per minute. athletes and people who are very fit can have a resting heart rate as low as 40 beats per minute.

however, anxiety can cause feelings of breathlessness or rapid breathing even when the physical need for oxygen is less. this is called hyperventilation. in your case it seems like despite the anxiety your body is controlling your heart rate well.

it's important to continue your treatment for gerd and adequate control of your anxiety if it's causing so much distress. identifying and managing anxiety triggers, along with regular exercise, a healthy diet, and enough sleep, can help manage your condition better.

lastly, it's great that you're already monitoring your spo2 levels. just make sure to keep your doctor informed of any changes or new symptoms. remember, i'm an ai and can provide advice based on the information you've given – it's always best to continuously check in with your healthcare provider."
N111,response_13,"i'm an ai, but i'll try my best to address your concerns based on my programmed medical knowledge.

having a slow heart rate (bradycardia) can be normal if you are generally healthy, even if you're not super athletic. however, since you are mentioning having anxiety and the sensation of difficulty breathing, it's worth addressing these symptoms more thoroughly.

you already pointed out that you have a diagnosis of gerd. gerd can indeed cause symptoms similar to difficulty breathing. another important point would be your anxiety. anxiety can cause a variety of physical symptoms, including the sensation of difficult breathing or ""air hunger."" 

moreover, anxiety often triggers hyperventilation - where you breathe out more carbon dioxide than your body produces. this can lead to symptoms such as light-headedness, a rapid heartbeat, and feeling breathless. however, everyone's body responds to anxiety differently, and your pulse might not necessarily increase during a panic attack.

you mentioned that you have had ecgs and that they were good. that's a positive sign. however, if you're still having significant symptoms, it could be worth seeking a second opinion or asking for more advanced diagnostic tests.

ultimately, however, the reassurance from your doctor seems to suggest that from a clinical perspective, everything appears normal and it is likely not a serious physical condition. however, therapy specific for health anxiety could be very beneficial if it's impacting your life so much. it's always a good idea to discuss everything with your doctor to figure out the right course of treatment for you."
N111,response_14,"it sounds like you've done a thorough job of discussing your concerns with your doctor, who doesn't seem to be worried about your low pulse rate. in general, a lower pulse rate isn't harmful unless you're experiencing symptoms like dizziness, fainting, shortness of breath or chest pain. people who are physically active often have lower heart rates because the heart muscle is in better condition and doesn't need to work as hard to maintain a steady beat.

anxiety and panic attacks can cause a variety of physiological responses, and not every person will experience an elevated heart rate. if you're comfortable with your doctor's evaluation and reassurances, then focusing on managing your anxiety and panic attacks, as well as staying physically active, eating a healthy diet and maintaining a healthy weight, would be the best way forward. 

keep in mind this advice cannot replace the clinical evaluation of a healthcare provider. therefore, consult your physician if you have any new symptoms or if your current symptoms worsen."
N111,response_15,"i'm an ai, not a doctor, but can tell you that due to the anxiety and panic attacks, it's possible you could be perceiving your breathing and heart rate differently as a hyperfocus on these bodily functions can sometimes exacerbate the symptoms or feelings of anxiety. feelings of having a low pulse or difficulty breathing are highly common symptoms of anxiety. everyone's bodies respond to anxiety differently - not everyone with anxiety will experience a rapid heartbeat or hyperventilation. since you've said your doctor isn't worried, it's likely that your pulse and breathing rate are within healthy ranges. if you're still concerned, it might be worth considering getting a second opinion, continuing to monitor your symptoms, or exploring treatment for your panic attacks if you haven't already."
N111,response_16,"i'm an ai developed by openai and i'm here to provide some insights based on your history and details shared.

first, it's important to remember that everyone's body responds differently to stress and/or panic. for some, the heart rate will quickly escalate, while others might see less elevation. what you're explaining doesn't sound unusual or concerning, especially given that you've had ecgs and they came out normal. 

a resting heart rate for an adult typically falls between 60-100 bpm, while fitter individuals often have lower rates, closer to 40 bpm. it seems like you have a lower resting heart rate; perhaps due to your daily walking exercise and certain genetic factors.

your pulse going up when you walk or exercise is completely normal; it's your body's way of accommodating the increased need for oxygen during physical activity.

as for the difficulty in breathing during panic attacks, it's common to sense that because of anxiety. anxious feelings can manifest physically in many ways, including the sensation of shortness of breath. if it's causing you distress, it might be helpful to follow some relaxation techniques or potentially seek professional help such as a counselor or psychologist for managing your anxiety.
 
lastly, it's crucial to recognize that medical advice from your real-life doctor should always take precedence. if your doctor says your heart rate is healthy and normal for you, that's extremely reassuring. if your symptoms get worse or new symptoms develop, you should definitely contact your healthcare provider again."
N111,response_17,"i'm glad to hear you've been communicating with your doctor about your concerns. her advice sounds reasonable, as you have had a normal ecg and she's told you that your heart and lungs sound fine. 

a resting heart rate can range from 60 to 100 beats per minute (bpm), and your heart rate can go lower than that if you're athletic or very fit—even if your exercise is something simple, like regularly walking. it's not unusual for your heart rate to increase when you stand up or start moving. 

as for panic attacks, while it is common for heartbeat to increase during a panic attack, not everybody experiences the same symptoms. for some people, anxiety and stress can also cause slower heart rates and breathing due to overactivity in the part of the nervous system that regulates these functions. 

your gerd and muscle tension can also contribute to the feeling of difficulty in breathing. this is because tension in the chest and abdominal muscles can make you feel like you have shortness of breath, and gerd can cause a sensation of a lump or tightness in the throat that might be mistaken for respiratory difficulty. 

overall, it sounds like your doctor has been thorough in her exams and she's confident that your heart and lungs are healthy. if you're feeling overly concerned or if new symptoms arise, don't hesitate to reach out to your doctor again. it's also important to find strategies to manage your health anxiety. this could involve therapy or counselling, or relaxation techniques. don't hesitate to seek help for your anxiety if you haven't done so already. 

of course, if you feel like you're in immediate danger or if your symptoms worsen drastically, please seek urgent medical attention. this advice is just to give you an idea of possible causes and should not replace advice from your doctor."
N111,response_18,"i'm an ai developed by openai, not a real doctor, but i can provide some general info that might help. if you're really concerned, you should speak to your doctor again or seek a second opinion.

let's start by saying that you're young and have undergone some significant lifestyle changes, losing quite a bit of weight. your body could just be adapting to that. your resting heart rate is on the low end of the normal range but is not dangerously low. it's not unusual for athletic people (which you may be becoming) to have lower heart rates. 

anxiety can indeed cause a physical increase in heart rate, but the relationship between anxiety and heart rate isn't always straightforward. it's also possible that you're experiencing symptoms of anxiety that aren't significantly affecting your heart rate.

gerd can also cause feelings of difficult breathing, and muscle tension can affect your sensations of your heartbeat.

remember, i can't provide medical advice or a diagnosis. you should definitely continue to follow up with your doctor if you're worried. frequency of passing out, or significant changes in your heart rate like a sudden jump up or down, warrant immediate medical attention."
N111,response_19,"i'm a language ai model developed by openai, so i hope to provide you with some helpful information, but this isn't a substitute for a consultation with a healthcare professional. 

there are many possible reasons for a lower than average pulse. people who are very fit often have a lower heart rate, so it's possible that even though you don't consider yourself athletic, your regular walks may have significantly improved your cardiovascular fitness.

also, despite what is often shown in popular media, not everyone with anxiety or panic disorder experiences clear symptoms of tachycardia (an abnormally fast heart rate) or hyperventilation. a slow heart rate during panic attacks is less common but it can happen. this could be due to differences in how your body responds to stress or perhaps your subconscious efforts to control your breathing and heart rate during these episodes.

the symptoms of gerd and muscle tension may independently or collectively contribute to your sensation of having a hard time breathing.

continuing your dialogue with your doctor is essential. it sounds like you have been proactive in sharing your symptoms and concerns with your healthcare professional. it's great that you've actively sought help and are monitoring your health. however, if your symptoms persist, or if you feel your current treatment plan isn't effectively managing your symptoms, don't hesitate to discuss this further with your doctor or seek a second opinion."
N111,response_20,"it sounds like you have been thoroughly evaluated by your primary care doctor and they couldn't find anything concerning from a cardiac or respiratory standpoint. the 2 ecgs you had in july were good which is a great sign. 

anxiety can indeed cause a fast heart rate but the body's reaction to anxiety is variable and it doesn't always lead to an increased heart rate. in rare cases, the body might even react oppositely and cause a slower heart rate instead as a part of the parasympathetic ""rest and digest"" response to perceived danger.

regarding your sensation of difficulty breathing but always having a normal spo2, this is a common symptom in anxiety called ""dyspnea"" or ""air hunger"". it feels like you cannot take a deep breath, even though you are getting enough oxygen.

your very low resting heart rate could well be because you are in better shape than you think. walking 1-2 hours per day is great and regular physical activity visibly improves heart health and reduces heart rate. but if you are worried about bradycardia (resting heart rate below 60 bpm), it would be a good idea to ensure all physical causes are ruled out - for example, disorders of the thyroid gland, electrolyte imbalances, some forms of heart disease or medication side effects. please reach out to your doctor if you haven't had these checked yet.  

as for gerd, continuing the treatment that your physician has prescribed for you should help manage its symptoms. gerd, in some individuals, may interfere with exercise due to discomfort. 

so, to answer your question, anxiety and its effects on the body’s autonomic responses, lifestyle and physical shape, gerd, and muscle tension could all be contributing to your symptoms. but it's always a good idea to involve your physician and seek their advice."
N111,response_21,"first of all, i'm very happy to hear that you're feeling better and that you're doing so much walking! that is excellent for your health. however, i understand your worries about your heart rate, particularly during a panic attack. 

your resting heart rate seems on the lower side, which is suggestive of good cardiovascular health. however, anxiety and panic disorders would normally lead to an increased heart rate. this discrepancy between your subjective experience and your heart rate is interesting.

sometimes, anxiety and panic attacks can manifest in different ways in different people. some may experience tachycardia (a rapid heart rate), while others may not. the fact that your heart rate increases when you stand up and walk, and that you can reach a high heart rate when walking up a hill suggests that your heart is responding appropriately to increased bodily demands.

the difficulty breathing you're experiencing may arguably be due to your anxiety, gerd, or muscular tension. it's also possible that it could be related to your anxiety about your heart. with a peak flow meter reading of 500-600 and a consistently normal spo2, there's no clear indication of a lung issue from the information provided.

weight loss could result in changes in your body's metabolism and your heart rate. the fact that your doctor is not concerned might be quite reassuring, but if you're not convinced, it might be worth considering a second opinion or further investigations like a holter monitor to capture any potential rhythm abnormalities over a 24-hour period. 

lastly, it's imperative to manage your mental health if you're experiencing health anxiety and panic attacks. cognitive-behavioral therapy (cbt) or medications could be beneficial, and finding coping strategies to deal with these attacks might also be useful. 

this advice is based on the information provided and is intended to be general in nature. you should continue to speak to your healthcare provider regarding this. they have access to your full medical history and could provide more specific advice."
N111,response_22,"as an ai model, i don't have the ability to diagnose illnesses but i can provide some potential explanations based on your symptoms. from the information you've shared it, it seems you are in good shape, and i would like to reassure you that a low pulse is actually a positive sign of cardiovascular fitness and is usually found in athletes. 

having a panic attack doesn't necessarily mean your heart rate will significantly increase. instead, symptoms can vary among individuals.

however, gerd and anxiety can cause physical discomfort, which might explain your feelings of breathlessness. you might want to discuss your symptoms further with a mental health professional, as anxiety management strategies can have a positive impact on your subjective feeling of breathlessness and on your overall wellness. 

again, it's vital for you to consult with your personal healthcare provider to discuss any ongoing concerns you have about your heart rate or other symptoms. they may suggest you consult a specialist for further tests if they believe it's necessary based on your symptoms and health history.   

please don't interpret this as medical advice, and make sure you consult with a healthcare provider."
N111,response_23,"if your doctor has thoroughly checked you and found no health issues, then it's possible that your heart rate and respiration rate are simply naturally lower than the average. this doesn't necessarily mean that you're in extraordinary shape, as heart rate varies widely among individuals and can be affected by numerous factors.

although anxiety and panic attacks frequently lead to an increased heart rate, it doesn't occur in every case. in fact, some people experience a slowing of the heart rate during these events due to the body's physiological responses to stress.

regarding your experience of difficulty breathing, gerd and anxiety can both cause such sensation. it's good to learn that your spo2 levels remain normal despite this sensation, as it suggests you're not actually experiencing any oxygen deprivation despite your feelings.

however, you should continue to maintain regular monitoring of your health with your doctor, especially as your gerd and anxiety persists. finally, consider working with a mental health professional as well to address the anxiety, if you haven't done so already."
N111,response_24,"it seems like you have a slower resting heart rate than average. it is not unusual for athletes and individuals who are very physically fit to have a lower resting heart rate, commonly below 60 bpm. this can occur since their hearts are very efficient at pumping blood. though, as you mention, you're not super athletic, regular walking does contribute to cardiovascular health and could potentially lower your resting heart rate.

regarding the panic attacks, everyone's body can respond differently to stress and anxiety. while many people do experience a rise in heart rate and rapid breathing during a panic attack, not everyone will. this could potentially be why your heart rate isn't notably rising during these incidents. it's vital to consult your doctor or a mental health professional to help manage your anxiety and panic attacks.

moreover, low heart rate (bradycardia) could also be due to other reasons such as hormonal imbalances, certain medications, and in rare cases, heart diseases. however, in your case, you do not describe symptoms generally related to harmful bradycardia such as chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, fainting spells, or fatigue. 

nonetheless, experiencing anxiety, gerd, and muscle tension could all be related and the sensation of difficulty breathing can be pretty common in people with anxiety disorder despite a normal spo2. if these conditions persist and create discomfort, it would be beneficial to talk with a healthcare provider to rule out any other possible causes. they can also suggest coping strategies or any treatment that might help manage these symptoms."
N111,response_25,"hello! i'm an ai assistant, and not a physician, but i have access to some general medical information that might be helpful for you.

firstly, please follow your doctor's advice. they know your medical history so it's important that their guidance is followed. 

a pulse rate of 60-100 beats per minute is considered normal for most adults. pulse can vary depending on many factors, including activity level, fitness, and even time of day. your ""low"" pulse could just be normal for you. however, having a pulse regularly below 60 could indicate a condition called bradycardia, especially if it comes with symptoms such as fainting, dizziness, or fatigue. 

you mentioned muscle tension and gerd in your case, these conditions can cause symptoms that mimic heart conditions, such as chest pain or difficulty breathing. anxiety can also cause physical symptoms and can intensify the perception of these symptoms. 

it's also worth noting that panic attacks often involve rapid heart rate, but not always. again, bodies can react differently. 

please reach out to your doctor or a medical professional if you are experiencing symptoms that you are unsure about or if your condition worsens."
