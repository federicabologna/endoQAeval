N194,response_2,"i'm an ai language model and while i can provide general advice and suggestions, i cannot replace a healthcare professional's advice. the symptoms you're describing, especially the episode of feeling like your heart stopped, having difficulties breathing, feeling dizzy, and blacking out are very serious and it's important to get immediate medical attention. it might be something benign or linked to your anxiety, but it could also indicate an issue with your heart. a holter or event monitor, which monitor your heart over a longer period of time, might be helpful to identify any potential issues. please reach out to a healthcare professional as soon as you can to discuss your symptoms."

N194,response_4,"i'm sorry to hear that you're experiencing these scary symptoms, but as an ai, i can't make a diagnosis or give medical advice. it's essential that you see a doctor who can take a thorough medical history, perform a physical exam, and order necessary tests. the symptoms you're experiencing could be related to various conditions, including panic disorder or heart problems. please seek immediate medical attention, especially if you're experiencing chest pain, shortness of breath, or feeling faint."
N194,response_5,"i'm an ai, not a doctor, but i can share some general advice. chest discomfort, difficulty breathing, dizziness, and blackouts are serious symptoms that require immediate medical attention. your symptoms could be due to a variety of heart conditions, such as arrhythmias, or they may be related to your low blood pressure, which can cause similar symptoms. anxiety can also mimic these symptoms. it's important that you see a healthcare provider immediately and explain your symptoms; they may refer you to a cardiologist for further testing. don't delay as these symptoms should not be ignored."

N194,response_7,"i'm an ai, but based on your symptoms i urge you to seek immediate medical attention. chest discomfort and shortness of breath are serious symptoms that need to be investigated by a healthcare professional as soon as possible. they may suggest additional tests like a prolonged ekg monitoring (holter monitor) or stress tests. your symptoms can be related to your heart, but can also be caused by other conditions like anxiety or panic disorders. please visit a healthcare provider urgently."

N194,response_9,"i'm an ai developed by openai and while i can provide a few ideas about your current health condition, this is really not a substitute for professional medical advice. it's critical that you seek medical attention immediately if you haven't already, especially since you have described a severe symptom - a sudden inability to breathe/excessive heat and dizziness/blackout - which might suggest a serious heart condition. 

a change in heart rate with respiration is called sinus arrhythmia, and it is generally considered normal, especially in younger people. however, it doesn't seem like your main issue right now. 

in terms of what could possibly be happening, your symptoms might be a sign of a heart rhythm disorder, valvular heart defect, or cardiomyopathy, but it might also be something far less serious like anxiety or panic attacks. regardless, it's essential to investigate these possibilities with a doctor. 

once again, please contact your healthcare provider immediately and describe the episode you had in detail. they should be able to guide you on next steps, which could include some of the following tests: a repeat, longer duration ekg/ecg; a holter monitor (a portable device you wear which records heart rhythm for 24 hours or more); an echocardiogram to evaluate structure and function of your heart; stress tests; cardiac ct/mri; or electrophysiological studies to closely evaluate heart rhythm problems. 

given the fact that you describe a blackout event, this could be a medical emergency. please don't hesitate, go to an emergency department as soon as you can."

N194,response_11,"i'm an ai and can't provide a diagnosis, but i can suggest you go to the emergency room right away. if you feel you're experiencing a cardiac event, please don't wait for online advice. although anxiety can cause physical symptoms, you're describing several serious symptoms that warrant immediate medical attention. despite the previous normal ekg results, it's possible something could have changed since your last doctor's visit."

N194,response_20,"i'm an ai assistant and not a doctor but based on what you described, it's crucial that you seek medical attention as soon as possible. you should never ignore chest discomfort and symptoms like trouble breathing, dizziness, or blacking out, even if these symptoms are brief. these are serious symptoms that could be related to your heart or other important systems in your body. anxiety can also cause real physical symptoms, but it's important to rule out any serious health conditions. go to the emergency room or call your doctor right away."
