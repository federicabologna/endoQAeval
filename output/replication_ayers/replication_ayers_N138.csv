N138,response_1,"from the report, it seems like there is some fatty buildup (steatosis) in your liver. this is a fairly common condition and can be improved with lifestyle changes such as a healthy diet and regular exercise. the report also noted a small lesion in your liver, but it's too small to accurately identify (subcentimeter and low-attenuation). it's likely nothing to worry about as the vast majority of these are benign. a follow up may be recommended by your doctor. the rest of your liver (hepatic parenchyma), gallbladder and bile ducts (biliary system) appear to be normal.

it is understandable that you're anxious but try not to worry too much. it's a good sign that they found nothing significant related to your pain. do discuss the findings with your doctor, they may recommend following up on it just to monitor any changes. you can also discuss lifestyle changes with them that can help keep your liver healthy and reduce the fatty buildup."
N138,response_2,"steatosis refers to fatty liver disease, which is when fat has built up in the liver and could be a sign of excess alcohol consumption, obesity, insulin resistance, or type 2 diabetes. diet and lifestyle changes could help manage it. the subcentimeter lesion in the liver is, statistically speaking, most likely benign, as mentioned in the report. that means it's not cancerous. biliary dilatation refers to the expansion of the bile duct which holds the body's bile, a fluid produced by the liver to digest fat. no biliary dilatation indicates a normal bile duct. calcified stones in the gallbladder could lead to gallstones, which are small, hard deposits that form in the gallbladder. no calcified stones were found. despite your worries, these findings are quite normal and not cause for too much concern. however, you should discuss these results further with your healthcare provider. they will be able to provide you with a more accurate interpretation of your results and what they could mean for you."
N138,response_3,"hi there, the findings suggest that your liver appears normal in size, but there is a mild ""fattiness"" (steatosis) of the liver. this is quite common and often related to factors like diet or alcohol use, but can also be seen without any apparent cause.

the lesion they found is small and not able to be fully assessed by ct scan. however, as per their description, it is most likely benign (non-cancerous). smaller lesions are most often benign. 

the patent portal veins indicate that there is no issue with blood flow to the liver. the gallbladder seems normal without stones. importantly, these results should be reviewed with your own healthcare provider, who may recommend further imaging or monitoring for the lesion in the liver.

though the results may sound worrying, it's always best to go through them with your doctor and discuss any concerns you have."
N138,response_4,"this ct scan result is mostly normal. ""mildly low attenuation of the hepatic parenchyma consistent with steatosis"" means you have a bit of fat in your liver, which is not unusual but might warrant lifestyle changes if you have other risk factors for liver disease, such as obesity or excessive alcohol consumption.

most importantly, there is a small, ""subcentimeter"" lesion in your liver. ""too small to characterize by ct but statistically likely benign"" means that the lesion is so small that the ct scan can't give much information about it, but statistically speaking, it's most likely not cancerous. 

""portal veins are patent"" means your main liver veins are open and working as they should. ""no biliary dilatation"" and ""the gallbladder is unremarkable with no calcified stones"" means that your bile ducts and gallbladder, which help digest food, are normal.

however, you should remain in contact with your healthcare provider. they might recommend more tests to monitor the small lesion, or to get more detail, particularly if your symptoms don't resolve or if you start to develop new symptoms. 

finally, try not to worry too much: your scan didn't find anything acute or immediately concerning regarding your pain. plus, the vast majority of small liver lesions like yours turn out to be benign."
N138,response_5,"the report details the findings of the ct scan of your liver. it describes that you have mild steatosis, which equals to fatty liver. it's a very common condition linked with obesity, where there's an excessive accumulation of fat in the liver. it's a reversible condition when effectively managed with proper diet and exercise and usually doesn't lead to serious liver damage. however, if not treated can lead to more serious liver disease such as cirrhosis. 

there's also a small lesion found in your left liver lobe that can't be easily identified further with a ct scan, but it is likely to be benign based on its appearance and size, so it's usually nothing to worry about. 

the report also states that your portal veins (veins going to the liver) aren't blocked and there's no bile duct blockage or gallstones.

all in all, these results should not bring you stress -- in general, these are typical and common findings for many adults. you should eat well, exercise, maintain a healthy weight, and go for regular check-ups. if you have any further questions or concerns, you should discuss these results with the doctor who ordered the test for you for clarification. 

remember, it's ok to be anxious about these results, but discussing them with your provider can allay your fears."
N138,response_6,"i understand you may be feeling worried. while i can't replace a doctor's advice, i can give a general interpretation of what this radiology report means: 

- hepatobiliary: this refers to the liver, bile ducts, and gallbladder.
- the liver has a normal size with a smooth surface: this is good news; it means there are no signs of disease causing an enlarged or an uneven liver. 
- mildly low attenuation of the hepatic parenchyma consistent with steatosis: hepatic steatosis, also known as fatty liver, means there is a bit too much fat in your liver. this is a common condition often linked to overweight, high alcohol intake, diabetes, and high cholesterol. 
- subcentimeter low-attenuation lesion in the medial segment of the left hepatic lobe, too small to characterize by ct but statistically likely benign: a small area appears on the left liver lobe, but it's too tiny to make a definitive analysis with a ct. nonetheless, according to statistics, it's probably not harmful. 
- the portal veins are patent: this means the blood vessels that bring blood from digestive organs to the liver are open and clear. 
- there is no biliary dilatation and the gallbladder is unremarkable with no calcified stones: the bile ducts are not enlarged, which would suggest blockage, and the gallbladder appears normal with no hard deposits known as gallstones.

generally speaking, this report is mostly reassuring. however, the mention of liver steatosis could suggest the need for lifestyle changes. consult with your doctor for understanding these findings in the context of your personal health and for guidance on potential next steps. this could include further monitoring or tests, or actions you can take in terms of diet, exercise, and other lifestyle factors."
N138,response_7,"there does not appear to be anything alarming in your ct report. 

1. ""mildly low attenuation of the hepatic parenchyma consistent with steatosis"": this means that your liver appears to have some fat accumulation, a condition known as steatosis or fatty liver disease. this is quite common and can be related to a number of things, including diet, alcohol use, and obesity. 

2. ""there is a subcentimeter low-attenuation lesion in the medial segment of the left hepatic lobe, too small to characterize by ct but statistically likely benign"": this means that there is a very small abnormality on your liver, but it is too small to definitively identify on the ct scan. however, such small lesions are usually benign (not cancerous).

3. ""the portal veins are patent. there is no biliary dilatation and the gallbladder is unremarkable with no calcified stones"": your blood vessels in the liver and bile ducts are all normal. the gallbladder seems healthy and without stones.

given this information, i would advise not to worry too much. you should follow up with your primary care physician or a hepatologist (liver specialist) to discuss these findings, any potential necessary follow-up, and any lifestyle changes you might need to make. but remember, this information is not intended to replace the advice of a healthcare professional."
N138,response_8,"this ct report is describing a couple of findings in your liver. the mild low attenuation of the hepatic parenchyma consistent with steatosis just means there may be some fatty infiltration in your liver, or a fatty liver. this is a somewhat common condition often associated with obesity, diabetes, or excessive alcohol consumption. 

they also found a small lesion in your liver which they were not able to clearly identify due to its small size, but they go on to say it is statistically likely benign, which means it is very likely harmless. 

the report also notes that your portal veins (the major veins in the liver) are open and normal, there is no sign of bile duct dilation (which can sometimes indicate a blockage of some sort), and your gallbladder appears healthy with no sign of stones.

remember, these findings will need to be interpreted in conjunction with your symptoms, other results, and overall health, so it is always important to consult with your primary doctor or a specialist about these results. you may need repeat imaging or further tests depending on your individual circumstances and health profile."
N138,response_9,"the ct scan reveals that you have a fatty liver, also known as steatosis. this means that there is more fat in your liver than usual, which can happen from conditions like alcoholism or obesity. there is also a very small, likely harmless lesion in a section of your liver. because it is so small and most small lesions tend to be benign (not cancerous), the doctors can't say for sure what it is but odds favor it being not harmful. however, you should do follow-up imaging after a short period as advised by your doctor, to make sure there's no changes. your blood vessels and gallbladder appear to be healthy and normal."
N138,response_10,"this result suggests that there is a small area in the liver that is showing up differently on the ct scan. this area is described as being small (subcentimeter) and located in the medial segment of the left hepatic lobe. while it is too small to accurately determine the nature of this lesion using ct imaging, from a statistical standpoint, it is most likely benign (non-cancerous). the comment about steatosis indicates that there may be some fat accumulation in your liver, but it's a fairly common finding and not necessarily a cause for concern on its own. the rest of the anatomy appears to be normal, with normal blood flow through the liver and no problems with the bile ducts or gallbladder. 

remember, this should be discussed further with your doctor who can provide a comprehensive understanding of your results in relation to your symptoms and medical history."
N138,response_11,"the ct scan shows that you have a small amount of fat in your liver, which is known as steatosis. this is a common condition and is often related to obesity, high cholesterol, or diabetes. if not controlled, steatosis can sometimes lead to inflammation and damage to liver cells, but many people with steatosis never develop these complications and it can be managed and often reversed with weight loss and a healthy diet. 

the scan also shows a small lesion in your liver. according to the radiologist, it is so small that it is difficult to determine its nature on the ct scan, however statistically most of these small lesions are benign. it may be monitored over time to ensure that it does not grow or otherwise change, but it is not necessarily a cause for alarm.

overall, the findings in your liver are quite common and generally not a cause for serious concern, though you may need a follow-up visit to revisit these findings again. please discuss them further with your doctor, who understands your full medical history and can advise you more specifically."
N138,response_12,"the ct report indicates that you have a mild fatty liver (steatosis), which is a common condition where there is a build up of excess fat in the liver cells. this is often linked to being overweight or obese, but can also be due to alcohol, certain medications, or other medical conditions. 

the report also mentions a small lesion in the liver that is likely benign. in medical terms, 'subcentimeter' and 'low-attenuation' mean it's very small and possibly a cyst or a non-cancerous tumor. since it's too small, it's hard to identify precisely what it is with a ct scan. your doctor might decide to monitor it over time with regular scans to make sure it doesn't grow or become problematic.

finally, the report says that your portal veins (these are big veins that carry blood to the liver) are patent (open and functioning normally), there's no bile duct dilatation (enlargement of the tubes that carry bile from the liver and gallbladder to the small intestine), and your gallbladder looks normal with no gallstones.

in essence, while it's completely normal to feel concerned, the findings are very common and usually not serious. continue to follow up with your doctor for further guidance and possibly a plan to monitor the small lesion in your liver. it may also be helpful to discuss lifestyle modifications with your doctor to address the fatty liver, such as diet and exercise changes."
N138,response_13,"based on the ct scan findings you've written here, it appears that you have two main abnormalities:

mildly low attenuation of the hepatic parenchyma consistent with steatosis - this most likely suggests fatty liver disease, where fat has begun to build-up in your liver cells. this is often caused by obesity, high cholesterol levels, and/or high blood sugar levels. 

sub-centimeter low-attenuation lesion in the medial segment of the left hepatic lobe - this is a small growth or lump in your liver. right now, it's too small to determine exactly what it is but it's most likely benign, meaning not cancerous. 

however, you should follow up with a hepatologist or a gastroenterologist for further evaluation and management as necessary. your doctor might want to monitor this lesion or may recommend additional tests. also, if the steatosis is because of fatty liver disease, they'll probably suggest that you make some lifestyle changes, such as losing weight, getting more exercise, and eating a healthy, low-fat diet. 

it's natural to feel scared when you're facing unknown health issues. make sure to bring all your questions to your follow-up appointments, and keep an open line of communication with your doctor. it's important to understand what's happening with your body and to get the best care you can."
N138,response_14,"the report is indicating a few things. first, it indicates you have ""steatosis"" which is a technical term for fat accumulation in the cells of the liver. this is a form of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease that can cause inflammation and may progress to more serious liver disease if not addressed.

the other concern you may have is where the report mentioned a low-attenuation lesion in the left hepatic lobe. this simply means there's a small spot on the liver that is appearing differently on imaging. given the small size, your doctor cannot tell what it is specifically from the ct scan. however, it is likely benign (not cancerous), based on typical medical statistics. you may need further tests to specifically identify what this lesion is.

the other things mentioned in the report - normal size and surface of the liver, patent (open and unblocked) portal veins, no biliary dilatation, and an unremarkable gallbladder with no calcified stones, are all normal findings.

while it is understandable to be scared with these findings, the best thing would be discussing this with your doctor, who can guide you on any necessary next steps and treatments. and remember, these conditions could be improved by maintaining a healthy and balanced diet, regular exercise and avoidance of overconsumption of alcohol."
N138,response_15,"your results are overall reassuring with no significant findings that suggest serious illness or disease. the only issues noted were mild steatosis (also known as fatty liver disease) and a very small lesion in the liver.

steatosis or fatty liver is a commonly seen in many people and can be improved with lifestyle changes such as weight loss, a balanced diet, routine exercise, and avoiding alcohol.

the small lesion in your liver is less than 1 cm and is likely benign (not cancerous) based on statistics and its appearance on the scan. it is too small to be further characterized by the scan you had. depending on your medical history and physical exam, your doctor may recommend further monitoring or a follow-up scan.

still, you should discuss these results with your healthcare provider, they can guide you on the next steps based on your history and symptoms. your doctor is best equipped to interpret your results in the context of your overall health. this analysis is just based on information provided and doesn't replace a consultation with your doctor."
N138,response_16,"the report shows multiple findings related to your liver. 

""steatosis"" refers to the excessive accumulation of fat within the liver cells, also known as fatty liver. it often occurs due to obesity or excessive alcohol consumption, but can also be caused by various other factors.

the ""low-attenuation lesion in the medial segment of the left hepatic lobe"" is a small area that doesn't absorb the imaging contrast as much as the surrounding tissue. given its small size, the ct scan is not able to provide a definitive characterization, but statistically such lesions are usually benign (not cancerous).

the ""portal veins are patent"" means that your major blood vessels in the liver are not blocked and are functioning correctly. and a lack of ""biliary dilatation"" means that the channels that carry bile from your liver to the small intestine are of normal size, which is good.

the ""gallbladder is unremarkable with no calcified stones"" suggests that your gallbladder is normal and doesn't show signs of stones (hardened deposits that can form in the gallbladder).

while your report suggests potential fatty liver disease, the findings overall are quite reassuring. however, it is essential for you to follow up with your doctor to discuss these results, as they can provide a comprehensive understanding of them in the context of your overall health. they may suggest lifestyle modifications or additional tests to keep an eye on these findings over time."
N138,response_17,"the findings from your ct scan sound relatively normal. ""mildly low attenuation of the hepatic parenchyma consistent with steatosis"" refers to a common, generally harmless condition called fatty liver, in which you have slightly more fat in your liver than typical. 

the ""subcentimeter low-attenuation lesion in the medial segment of the left hepatic lobe"" is a small mark or spot on your liver that is too small to identify exactly by ct scan. however, these small ""lesions"" are often benign (non-cancerous). 

the report also says your portal veins (the veins that carry blood to your liver) are open (patent) and there are no issues with your bile ducts or gallbladder.

it's always best to discuss your results with your doctor as they will be able to explain in details and reassure you. if there was any cause for immediate concern, the report would likely have said so. please consult with your physician to fully understand your results and to ask any further questions you may have."
N138,response_18,"i am an ai developed to assist doctors and patients, but i would recommend talking to the healthcare provider who originally ordered the report for a full analysis. however, i can try to help explain some of the medical terms in this report to help you understand it better:

1. ""mildly low attenuation of the hepatic parenchyma consistent with steatosis"": this means that your liver tissue (hepatic parenchyma) may have some fat in it. this condition is called steatosis, or more commonly fatty liver disease. it's not uncommon, and is often associated with obesity, diabetes, and other metabolic disorders. a doctor can confirm this diagnosis and suggest management techniques which may include lifestyle changes like a healthy diet and regular exercise.

2. ""there is a subcentimeter low-attenuation lesion in the medial segment of the left hepatic lobe, too small to characterize by ct but statistically likely benign"": this means that there’s a small spot on your liver that’s less dense than the surrounding tissue, but it's too small to determine its exact nature. the report suggests it's likely harmless (benign), but further assessment may be required.

3. ""the portal veins are patent"": this is good news; it means that the veins that carry blood from your gastrointestinal tract, gallbladder, pancreas, and spleen to your liver are open and not blocked.

4. ""there is no biliary dilatation and the gallbladder is unremarkable with no calcified stones"": your gallbladder, which stores bile and is part of your biliary system, appears to be normal, and there are no gallstones present.

if you have further concerns, please consult with your healthcare provider."
N138,response_19,"the ct scan report shows that you have fatty liver (steatosis) which is a very common condition. the report also mentions a small lesion in the left lobe of your liver which is too small to characterize but is likely benign (non-cancerous). the report specifically mentions that it is 'statistically likely benign,' which means that based on the size and imaging characteristics, it is more likely to be non-threatening. while it’s understandable to be worried, please know that most liver lesions are benign (non-cancerous). the scan also shows that your liver size and surface is normal, your portal veins (these are the large veins that carry blood to the liver) are open (patent), there is no sign of blockage in your bile ducts (biliary dilatation), and your gallbladder did not show any abnormalities or stones. you might need to have a follow-up scan or other tests depending on your doctor's advice to monitor the lesion. it's also crucial to manage fatty liver disease which is often seen in people who are overweight or obese, have high cholesterol, have diabetes, or consume alcohol excessively. by improving your diet and increasing physical activity, one can typically manage or reverse this condition. please follow up with your doctor for further management."
N138,response_20,"there are a few things mentioned in this report. it mentions low attenuation of the hepatic parenchyma consistent with steatosis, which means there is some fat in the liver. this is not uncommon and can occur with conditions such as obesity or alcohol consumption, but it can be improved with changes in diet and exercise. 

the report also mentions a small lesion in your liver. it's too small to characterize by ct, meaning they can't tell exactly what it is because of its size. however, the report notes that it is statistically likely to be benign, or not cancerous. 

the last thing the report mentions is that your portal veins are patent (meaning they're open, which is good), and that there's no biliary dilatation (which means your bile ducts are of normal size). your gallbladder is also normal.

it's important to note that the ""statistical likelihood"" is based on the overall prevalence of benign vs malignant diseases in the general population and does not take into account individual risk factors. the next step is typically to perform an ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging (mri) scan for further characterization of the lesion.

keep in touch with your doctor, who can clarify what these findings mean in the context of your total health picture and what the next steps may be. you might need further examination to learn more about the lesion but the results discussed in this report are not particularly alarming or indicative of an emergency."
N138,response_21,"the medical report seems to say that your liver overall seems normal in size and shape. however, it also appears that you may have a condition called steatosis (also known as fatty liver) which is a result of the build-up of fat in the liver and this condition is usually seen in people who drink a lot of alcohol, people with high cholesterol and overweight individuals. it's a reversible condition and can be improved with the right diet and lifestyle changes. 

furthermore, the report also says there is a small lesion in the left part of your liver. lesion is a medical term which could mean any abnormal change in tissue. however, at the size it’s reported as, it’s too small for the ct to fully assess what kind of lesion it is. however, it's statistically likely to be benign, meaning it's not cancerous. 

the last few sentences indicate that your blood flow through the liver seems normal, there's no accumulation of bile in your liver, and your gallbladder seems fine without any issue noted.

however, you should schedule a follow-up with your doctor to discuss these findings and understand what this means for your health moving onwards. you'd likely need further diagnostic tests to characterise the liver lesion. 

don't be scared - many people are walking around with small lesions in their liver that they're not aware of, and it's very unlikely that it's something serious. take care of yourself and do follow up with your doctor."
N138,response_22,"this ct report is detailing the findings related to your liver and related areas (the hepatobiliary system). 

key points are:

1. hepatic steatosis is another term for fatty liver disease, meaning there is a higher than normal amount of fat stored in your liver. this can be reversed through healthy changes to diet and lifestyle.

2. the low-attenuation lesion is a spot in your liver. it is very small and likely harmless (benign). although it can't be definitively classified due to its small size, statistically, these types of small lesions are typically benign. 

3. patent veins mean your veins are open and allowing blood flow, which is good. 

4. there is no biliary dilatation, which means your bile ducts (that carry bile from the liver and gallbladder to the small intestine) are not abnormally widened.

5. your gallbladder is unremarkable, with no signs of disease or stones.

it's extremely common to be worried when reading medical reports, as they often contain complex language and can be difficult to understand completely. however, it's important to have a conversation with your healthcare provider who can explain these results in more detail and provide relevant next steps. this can help ease any fears and explain possible lifestyle changes or treatment options moving forward."
N138,response_23,"this report is coming from a ct scan of your liver. steatosis (fatty liver) is common and can be addressed by losing weight and avoiding alcohol. the low-attenuation lesion noted is quite small (subcentimeter) and located in the left lobe of your liver. this means it's too small to definitively identify with a ct scan. however, given its size and appearance, it is very likely to be a benign (noncancerous) growth. the statement about your portal veins being patent means that they are open and not blocked, which is good. no biliary dilatation means that the ducts that carry bile from your liver to your gallbladder are not unnaturally wide or blocked, and that the gallbladder appears to be normal, without signs of stones. thus, while the report should be discussed thoroughly with your doctor, the general interpretation does not seem to be anything alarmingly serious. you should still follow up with your physician to discuss the findings and next steps if needed."
N138,response_24,"the results from your ct scan suggest that your liver is of normal size, with a normal appearance. the low attenuation of the hepatic parenchyma refers to fatty liver disease, also known as steatosis. this condition often has no symptoms and can occur in individuals who drink little to no alcohol. it can, however, impede liver function if left untreated. 

the report also mentions a small (subcentimeter) low-attenuation lesion in the left hepatic lobe of your liver. ""low-attenuation"" essentially means the spot appears lighter on the scan. this spot is too small to definitively determine what it is via the ct scan, but the odds are in favor of it being benign (non-cancerous).

the assertion that the portal veins are patent means they are open and blood is flowing freely. this is good. 

there is no biliary dilatation means that the ducts which transport bile from the liver to the gallbladder are of normal size and there is no blockage.

lastly, your gallbladder seems to be normal based on the ct scan, with no evidence of gallstones. 

while this may seem alarming, keep in mind that this is information for your healthcare provider to use in context with other clinical findings. continue talking to them about any symptoms or concerns. they may recommend options such as lifestyle changes, medications, or additional diagnostic tests for the lesion, if necessary. but overall, your results suggest mostly benign findings."
N138,response_25,"the report indicates you have fatty liver disease, also known as steatosis. this is a common condition usually seen in people who are overweight or have diabetes. it means you have excess fat in your liver. lifestyle changes including a healthy diet, losing weight, and regular exercise can help to manage fatty liver disease.

the report also mentions a small lesion in your liver. it's too small to say exactly what it is, but according to statistics, it's likely benign, which means it's not cancer. the doctors would need to monitor this on future scans.

the good news is the rest of your liver appears healthy. the blood vessels (portal veins) are open and your gallbladder is normal with no gallstones.
  
it's a good idea to follow up with a gastroenterologist for further evaluation and management. please don't worry but do follow up with the doctor's recommended care and guidance. it's important to catch these things early and this is why these scans are done."
