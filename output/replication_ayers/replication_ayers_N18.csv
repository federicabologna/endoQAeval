N18,response_1,"i'm really sorry to hear you're going through this - i'm sure it's quite unsettling to feel intermittent testicular pain. here are some other things that could be causing your pain, although you should definitely find a doctor for a confirmation:

1. inguinal hernia: this is a weakness in the lower abdominal wall that allows fatty tissue or a part of the bowel to push into the groin.

2. orchitis: this is an inflammation of either one or both of your testicles that's usually caused by a bacterial or viral infection.

3. trauma or injury: even minor injuries can cause significant testicular pain.

4. nerve damage: the nerves in your groin area can be under pressure for various reasons - this can cause pain and discomfort.

5. testicular pain syndrome: this is a chronic pain that comes from the testicles, although the exact cause isn't always found.

6. prostatitis: this is an inflammation of the prostate that can cause pain radiating to the testicles.

please take note that you can develop sudden severe pain again, even after being previously evaluated for testicular torsion and discharged due to normal findings. this sudden severe pain might be an emergency situation - torsion can come and go. it's also worth considering that factors such as stress & anxiety can contribute to the sensitivity of pain. 

you should definitely reach out to a healthcare provider, a urologist if possible, to follow up with this issue. discuss with them the possible causes and have a plan ready for managing your pain, as well as for emergency situations - you shouldn't ignore any sudden severe testicular pain. va healthcare should be able to help once your application is approved. until then, try to rest, avoid strenuous activities, and apply a cold pack to the area (but wrap it in cloth to protect your skin!). 

remember, this advice is intended to be general in nature, and specific causes may not apply to your situation. always consult with a healthcare provider for accurate information."
N18,response_2,"i'm a virtual assistant and i'm not a doctor, but i can give you some possible causes based on your symptoms. although you've been ruled out for a number of conditions, other possible causes for your symptoms could include injury, hernia, or nerve constriction - these can cause pain even if your testicles look normal on an ultrasound. conditions like inguinal hernias (when part of the intestine/abdominal organ protrudes through the inguinal canal and into the groin region) or nerve compression issues may not be picked up on a testicular ultrasound and could necessitate further investigation. given your pain along with the symptoms, a hernia would also be a possibility to explore. 

however, you definitely need to see a healthcare professional for a further evaluation. it is important that you contact a healthcare provider soon. even though you lack insurance right now, there are hopefully other resources you can utilize- including free clinics, offer sliding scale fees, or may have knowledge of organizations that provide financial assistance. please take care of your health first. take necessary precautions and ensure to get the right treatment."
N18,response_3,"i'm really sorry to hear that you're going through this. while i can't diagnose you, i can suggest some possibilities that you can look into and maybe get a sense of reassurance. you could be experiencing something known as prostatitis, which is inflammation of the prostate, where symptoms may include pain in the groin, testes or lower back. 

another possibility is a urinary tract infection that's causing referred pain. this pain may be felt in the back (kidney area) and testicle. 

nerve entrapment, which is a pinched nerve somewhere in the nerve pathway (either from the spine or in the hip area), can also manifest as testicular pain. 

lastly, musculoskeletal problems can cause pain in the testicle area as well. it could be a pulled or strained muscle, or even something more chronic like a pelvic floor dysfunction.

it's really beneficial that you've undergone some initial testing. but, still don't hesitate to seek a second opinion. just make sure any way you approach this keeps in mind your comfort and peace of mind. good luck."
N18,response_4,"i'm really sorry to hear you're suffering. as you discovered, pain in the testicles or scrotum can be caused by various conditions including testicular torsion, epididymitis, varicocele, tumors, and kidney stones. however, you've been tested for these and all came back negative, which is a good sign. that being said, in some cases, the cause of testicular pain can be hard to pinpoint.

intermittent testicular torsion can occur, but usually presents with severe pain and other symptoms. an inguinal hernia, another condition that can cause testicular pain, would be apparent upon physical examination.

the pain you're experiencing could also be due to something like a muscle strain, nerve impingement, or referred pain from another area of the body (like potentially your back).

itâ€™s also possible you may have prostitis (inflammation of the prostate), which can cause pain in the testicular area. 

remember also that it's not uncommon for people to feel pain in areas like the testicles and to not be able to find a cause. this doesn't mean that the pain isn't real, but rather that sometimes our bodies have pain and we simply can't find a physical explanation for it. 

given your situation, there are a few things you might consider:

- find a low-cost clinic or urgent care center, they might be able to guide you toward resources or specialists that can help.

- consider reaching out to universities with medical schools. sometimes these institutions offer reduced-cost clinics for the public. 

- check online for resources and support for people without health insurance. you might qualify for coverage through medicaid or programs specific to your state.

- please keep in mind that while you're waiting for answers, it's important to manage the stress you're feeling. stress can exacerbate the symptoms you're experiencing, creating a frustrating cycle.

again, i'm really sorry you're in this situation and i hope you're able to find relief and answers soon."
N18,response_5,"i'm an ai assistant and while i can't replace a doctor, it seems like you might be suffering from referred pain. it refers to pain that's perceived at a location other than the site of the painful stimulus. for example, the pain you're experiencing in your testicle may actually be from another part of your body such as your abdomen or groin. it's also possible that you have a minor hernia that wasn't identified during your er visit. 

another possibility is testicular discomfort caused by nerve damage or nerve irritation, this can cause sharp intermittent pain and might not show up on an ultrasound.

please ensure you get a formal and complete evaluation with a health professional. in meantime, if the pain gets worse or if you develop other symptoms, such as fever, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, or testicular swelling, seek immediate medical attention.  

i'm afraid you'll have to wait for your medicaid and va healthcare applications to go through before you can get any more healthcare without incurring huge costs. it's definitely a difficult situation, but don't ignore your symptoms and make sure you seek medical advice."
N18,response_6,"i'm really sorry to hear that you're going through this. it sound like it must be incredibly frustrating and stressful for you, especially while dealing with the financial aspect of american healthcare.

while it's difficult to diagnose over the internet, there are a few possibilities that stand out. it could be some form of hernia, such as an inguinal hernia. alternatively, it might be a very mild case of epididymitis or orchitis that just wasn't severe enough to show up on the ultrasound. another possibility is testicular trauma, perhaps from minor injury you made not even realise you suffered. 

there's also a chance it could be something called ""prostadynia,"" which is essentially chronic prostate pain for which a clear cause cannot be identified. 

it's also possible, though less likely, that something else in the abdomen or pelvis is causing referred pain in the testicle. this could potentially include things like gastrointestinal or neurological problems.

however, in all these cases it would be usually accompanied by other symptoms or signs, like swelling, redness or urinary problems.

ultimately what you really need is a thorough exam and probably more testing by a urologist or other specialist, but i understand that might be difficult for you right now financially. maybe in the mean time, over-the-counter pain medication can provide some relief. 

you did the right thing by signing up for medicaid and va healthcare. if your condition is something serious, which it could be, those programs could help you get the care you need without causing you financial destitution.

and remember, it's okay to be scared. these symptoms are distressing and it's natural to be apprehensive about them. but you must keep these fears in perspective. while it's true that there is a small chance of something serious happening, there is a much bigger chance that this is something benign that can be easily treated. the important thing now is to try and stay calm, do what you can to manage the pain, and get to a doctor as soon as you are able."
N18,response_7,"i'm sorry to hear about the discomfort and pain you're experiencing. based on the tests you've already had, it doesn't sound like any of the common conditions associated with testicular pain. a hernia is a possibility as hernias can cause testicular discomfort and pain. another possibility is something called testicular appendage torsion, which can cause similar symptoms to testicular torsion but isn't as serious. it could also be something called referred pain, where a problem elsewhere in the body causes pain in the testicle. 

this being said, you should reach out to a primary care doctor or urologist for further consultation, as online advice can't replace an in-person examination and additional tests. pain in this area can be due to many things, some serious and some not, but you definitely need further evaluation. don't try to ignore it just because you're scared of a large bill. you've made the right step by applying for medicaid and va healthcare. i hope you get the help you need, and it's nothing serious."
N18,response_8,"i'm sorry to hear that you're going through this! an intermittent torsion or a hernia are like possibilities, but it could also be something like nerve irritation or musculoskeletal pain. 

another possibility could be referred pain from somewhere else, like from a problem in your lower back or abdomen. pain can sometimes be felt in a different part of the body than where the problem actually is (think about how people often feel arm pain during a heart attack).

sometimes, this kind of pain can also be caused by something more psychological, like stress or anxiety. knowing you're going through a tough time right now, it could be worth considering if that's influencing the pain you're feeling. 

i'm glad to hear you've applied for medicaid and va healthcare, and it's very important to get seen by a healthcare professional who can do a thorough assessment and ask you about any other symptoms you might be experiencing. 

the er is the best place to go for immediate concerns like sudden onset of testicular pain, and it's good to hear you were able to get that checked out and rule out more serious causes. at this point, it's likely best to make an appointment with a primary care doctor who can dive deeper into your history and help figure out what's going on."
N18,response_9,"i'm really sorry to hear that you're going through this. i'm a computer based ai, so i don't have medical training, but based on the information you provided, it's possible that you might have a hernia or a nerve irritation, infection or cyst. however, only a healthcare professional will be able to provide a confirmed diagnosis. 

while waiting for the approval of your medicaid or va healthcare, you could try taking over-the-counter pain medications such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen to help manage your pain, if you haven't yet. you should avoid lifting heavy objects to prevent any potential hernia from worsening, as well as avoiding activities like bicycle riding or heavy exercise that could exacerbate the pain. if the pain worsens acutely or if you start to experience symptoms like high fever, vomiting or severe abdominal pain, seek medical attention immediately.

i really wish i could help you more. please hang in there and see a healthcare provider as soon as you can."
N18,response_10,"i'm sorry to hear that you're going through this. sharp, shooting pain can be very distressing, especially when the cause is not clear.  

although i can't diagnose you through this platform, i can still give you some information which might be helpful to you. given you've mentioned a pain that's also radiating to the kidney area, it might be that the pain may not actually originate from the testicular area, but from somewhere higher up.

one possibility is a urinary tract infection. although utis are less common in men, they can still occur and can cause symptoms such as a burning sensation when urinating, increased frequency of urination, and pain and discomfort which can occasionally be felt in the testicular area. the most conclusive way to detect a uti is through a urine culture, which can be done rather easily.

another possible diagnosis could be a muscle strain in the abdominal or groin region. overexertion of these muscles can lead to discomfort and pain, which could possibly radiate to the testicles. 

different types of nerve entrapments or neuropathies might also be responsible for the pain. one nerve in particular that can cause symptoms similar to yours is the genitofemoral nerve. if there is entrapment or irritation of this nerve, it can cause intermittent, sharp pain in the testicular area.

other possible causes of testicular pain without apparent abnormality on ultrasound could include a cyst in the epididymis (spermatocele), stress and anxiety or referred pain from somewhere else like your back or prostate. 

you should definitely reach out to a primary care provider to discuss your symptoms further. they can help guide further testings and direct the most appropriate treatment. in the meantime, taking over the counter painkillers such as ibuprofen or paracetamol might be beneficial for the pain, provided you have no contraindications to these. 

this advice is intended to be general in nature, and specific causes may not apply to your situation. always consult with a healthcare provider for accurate information."
N18,response_11,"i'm really sorry to hear about your discomfort and the distress it's causing you. you could be dealing with a minor injury or nerve irritation. certain activities, such as biking and other forms of exercise, can occasionally cause testicular pain. alternatively, given that you're experiencing pain up towards the kidney area, this could be a referred pain, as is common with issues such as pinched nerves in the lower back or hip area.

however, it's worth highlighting that even though the er ruled out some of the critical conditions, unexplained persistent testicular pain still needs to be managed by a healthcare professional. it could potentially be a partial or intermittent torsion (as you suggested) or a smaller hernia that may not have been noticeable at the time of the er visit. a urologist would be the best specialist to see for this kind of issue. i would recommend you contact a healthcare provider to make an appointment as soon as you can. they could do further tests and possibly try you on some medications to help manage this pain. don't try to handle this on your own, professional advice is crucial."
N18,response_12,"i'm really sorry to hear that you're going through this. it must be very frightening.

it's hard to say exactly what could be causing your pain without being able to examine you in person. however, it is possible you could have a hernia or something similar, which can cause this sort of sharp, intermittent pain, although these usually cause other symptoms as well. 

other possibilities could be a urinary tract infection (although this is less common in men), a prostate issue, a strain or injury to the muscles or ligaments in the groin area, nerve-related pain, among others.

a partial intermittent torsion could theoretically be possible as well, although it would be rare to have such an issue that is not detected using an ultrasound. 

it's also possible this could be something like referred pain from somewhere else in your body, such as a problem with your back. 

it's really important to see a doctor to have these possibilities looked at in more detail, particularly given the intensity of the pain you're experiencing. in the meantime, you might find it helpful to apply a warm or cold compress to the area for 10-20 minutes at a time, or to take over-the-counter pain relievers if they're safe for you to use. 

please consult a medical professional immediately if any of these apply: the pain becomes severe and sudden, you have fever, you see blood in your urine, you're experiencing nausea or vomiting, your testicle is hard, swollen or tender, or you can feel a lump on your testicle."
N18,response_13,"i'm really sorry to hear you're going through this. as an ai developed by openai, i can't diagnose you or give a definitive answer, but i can suggest some other possibilities. another possible cause of testicular pain could be nerve-related, such as a pinched nerve in your lower spine. a common condition that can cause such symptoms is lumbar radiculopathy or sciatica. another possible cause could be chronic orchialgia or testicular nerve pain. 

however, it's also important to remember that even with a clean scan, torsion can not be fully excluded. intermittent torsion, as you suggested, might cause this intensely painful, come-and-go symptom.

given how severe your pain is, it is important you have this looked at again as soon as possible. if you haven't done so already, try to schedule an appointment with a primary care doctor or a urologist, who might have a better chance at diagnosing less common conditions.

lastly, try not to let anxiety about the situation consume you - stress and fear can sometimes amplify the perception of pain. until you can see a medical professional, try to manage the pain with over-the-counter analgesics â€“ as long as you don't have any conditions that contraindicate their use â€“ and rest.

remember, nothing replaces the advice of a healthcare professional who can personally examine you."
N18,response_14,"i'm an ai language model developed by openai and i can help you understand general health topics but i can't provide a diagnosis. given that critical conditions such as testicular torsion, kidney stones, and testicular cancer have been ruled out by the doctors it might be less serious issues but you should definitely continue to seek medical attention. for example, you could be feeling discomfort or pain related to a muscular or nerve problem, inflammation, or other issues not specifically related to the testicles, but these are just examples and you need to consult with a doctor for a proper diagnosis. 

factors like anxiety and stress can sometimes amplify the sensation of pain too. if you're feeling particularly stressed, consider trying some relaxation exercises like deep breathing or progressive muscle relaxation to manage your anxiety while you figure out what's going on medically.

i strongly advise you to follow up with a primary care physician or an urologist. they would conduct a detailed examination and review your tests. also, regarding your medical bills, it might be worth contacting the hospital's billing department. they may have a payment plan or financial assistance available."
N18,response_15,"i'm really sorry to hear that you're in pain and feeling scared! it's good that you've been seen at the er and they've ruled out dangerous conditions like testicular torsion, epididymitis, varicoceles, cancer, and kidney stones. that must offer a little peace of mind. it might indeed be a hernia, or perhaps some sort of nerve problem.

however, something else to consider is a condition called prostatitis, which is inflammation of the prostate. this isn't typically checked for in the er setting but it does commonly cause testicular pain. it's usually caused by bacterial infection but in some cases, the source of inflammation isn't clear.

also, it's great that you signed up for medicaid and va healthcare. seek immediate medical attention if the pain becomes severe, or you notice redness/swelling in the testicles, blood in your urine or severe abbominal pain.

i'm not an actual doctor though - make sure you take any advice with a pinch of salt and visit a professional healthcare provider when you get insured for evaluation.

just remember - 
interpret the information from an ai powered chatbot as a general guidance and not a definitive advice or a diagnosis. 

this advice is based on the information provided.

i strongly encourage you to get in touch with a healthcare provider who can provide a more accurate diagnosis based on a thorough physical examination and tests.

also, if you have any questions about my response, let me know. i'm here to help."
N18,response_16,"i'm really sorry to hear you're going through this. i understand your anxiety, but remember that this advice does not replace proper medical advice and you should seek help again if the pain persists.

testicular pain can be caused due to various reasons. even though the primary causes like testicular torsion, epididymitis, varicocele, cancer and kidney stones have been ruled out, it could still be other less common conditions that are causing your discomfort.

one option could be a hernia as you mentioned, specifically an inguinal hernia that can sometimes descend into the scrotum and cause testicular pain.

another possibility is an intermittent torsion, where the spermatic cord twists and then untwists before any significant damage is done. however, it will likely cause severe pain during the torsion period. 

a less well recognized cause could be a condition called 'orchalgia' or 'orchidynia', which are terms for long-term pain in the testicles of unknown cause. treatment generally involves pain management strategies.

another option could be related to nerves (like in back disorders) causing referred pain, or problems with the prostate or seminal vesicles might also cause testicular pain.

anxiety and stress can also lead to a heightened sense of pain and discomfort, which might potentially increase the impact of the testicle pain.

your next steps should be made in consultation with a healthcare professional - preferable a urologist. while you wait for medical insurance, do self examinations regularly looking for any changes in the testicle or for any lumps or bumps. also remember to try and stay calm and not let anxiety increase the body's perception of pain. 

again, this advice is not definite and any persistent pain needs to be evaluated by a healthcare professional. if the pain persists or worsens, please seek medical help."
N18,response_17,"you should not consider this as a direct medical advice since i'm an ai, but remember that a testicular pain could be due to many causes. it could be from an inguinal hernia, especially if you notice any lumps or bumps in your groin that become more prominent when you're standing, coughing or straining. 

remember to consider benign things such as musculoskeletal pain which can result from strain or heavy lifting, nerve issues, or even sometimes anxiety. it is also possible that the cause is idiopathic (no known cause) and not dangerous. 

over the counter nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories (like ibuprofen) can sometimes reduce the pain. sitting in a warm bath can also prove beneficial.

this advice is just a speculation, you must absolutely seek a medical council in person. please contact a healthcare provider, even a free clinic or planned parenthood, they should have resources available for you."
N18,response_18,"i'm really sorry to hear that you're going through this, this definitely sounds like a very difficult time for you. 

based on what you've described, and considering you already had the key conditions ruled out at the er, possibilities might include conditions such as orchitis, inguinal hernia, referred pain, nerve entrapment, or other non-specific genitourinary conditions.

orchitis is inflammation of the testicles which can be caused by many things, including infection. 

inguinal hernia is a condition in which tissue, such as part of the intestine, protrudes through a weak spot in the abdominal muscles, can potentially cause pain in the testicles.

alternatively, the pain may be referred from another area, such as the lower back or hip.

it is also important to take into consideration idiopathic (unidentified cause) testicular pain which happens in a considerable amount of patients. 

it's almost impossible to diagnose your condition through the internet, and it's best to seek advice from a specialist. it might be worth seeing a urologist, if you aren't able to do that, your primary care physician would point you in the right direction. please don't hesitate to seek medical help, especially if the pain is severe or worsening."
N18,response_19,"i'm a virtual assistant and not a doctor, but i can suggest a few other conditions that might cause testicular pain such as inguinal hernia, a nerve problem causing referred pain, or orchialgia which is chronic testicle pain with an unknown cause. also, even though the er checked for these, inflammation or infection can sometimes be missed, so it might be possible this could still be an issue. despite this, it's really important that you see a healthcare provider who can give you a thorough examination to identify the cause."
N18,response_20,"i'm really sorry to hear you're going through this, it's tough when you're experiencing pain and there doesn't seem to be an obvious cause.

even though all the typical causes were ruled out, pain in the testicular region can arise from a variety of different conditions, including infections, hernias, cysts, the use of certain medications, and in rare instances, nerve damage. it's also possible that this could be a referred pain from a different area, such as the lower back.

however, it's important not to panic and jump to conclusions. even if it's distressing, you've already taken the right first step by seeking medical attention. i would suggest continuing to seek medical advice, whether this is with a primary care doctor, urologist or at the er if the pain worsens or other symptoms start to appear. ensure to inform the doctor of all your symptoms, history, and the treatments that you have tried.

in the meantime, over-the-counter painkillers (like acetaminophen or ibuprofen) may help manage some of the discomfort. warm baths or heat packs might help too. 

i hope you can get some answers soon, and i really commend you on already taking steps to enroll in medicaid and va healthcare. that's an important step towards managing this issue effectively.

also, remember that reddit/this ai is not a substitute for professional medical advice. it's always a good idea to seek help from a healthcare professional."
N18,response_21,"i'm really sorry to hear you're going through this. as an ai, i can't examine you or provide a full diagnosis, but i can give some potential reasons for your symptoms. if your symptoms persist, you need to contact a healthcare provider right away, especially if the pain becomes severe.

inguinal hernia: a lump or swelling may be visible in the groin area, and sometimes the pain may intensify when you cough, bend, lift heavy objects or stand for a long time.

infection: certain infections, including utis or stis, can cause referred pain to the testicles. 

trauma or injury: an injury to the groin or testicle can cause lingering pain even once the initial injury has healed. 

nerve damage: conditions that affect the nerves, like a pinched nerve in the back or neuropathy, can cause referred pain to the testicles. 

psychosocial stress: severe or chronic stress, anxiety or depression can sometimes cause physical symptoms, including unexplained pain.

testicular pain is complex, and there are many possible causes. it's absolutely essential to follow up with a healthcare provider. you'll need a focused review of your symptoms and potentially an examination by a urologist or another specialist. if the pain is severe or if you experience other symptoms such as fever, chills, blood in the urine, or severe abdominal pain, seek emergency medical attention immediately."
N18,response_22,"i'm sorry to hear you're going through this, and it's unfortunate that the precise cause couldn't be identified at the emergency room. other conditions that could cause your symptoms might include a hernia, like you guessed, prostatitis (which is inflammation of the prostate gland), nerve-related conditions, psychoemotional stress, referred pain from other parts of the body, and testicular trauma.

sometimes, the cause is hard to identify because the pain might not be originating from the testicles at all part of the time but rather referred from elsewhere in the body (such as from a tight pelvic floor muscle, a nerve compression elsewhere).

you said the pain radiates up towards your left kidney area-- this could indicate a kidney or urinary tract issue despite your earlier tests. still, not all kidney problems are evident right away, and not every urinary tract issue shows up on immediate examination.

even if you believe that the er visit was a mistake, don't berate yourself: if you're experiencing a 6/10 pain, it's essential to get it checked out quickly, especially given the risk of testicular torsion (which can be a surgical emergency).

please follow up with a healthcare provider. the er visit was to rule out immediate life-threatening situations, but you still need to find a general practitioner or urologist who can guide the next steps in figuring out what's causing your symptoms. keep in mind that i'm an ai developed by openai, and while i'm based on a vast amount of medical literature and data, there's no substitute for an in-person evaluation when it comes to your health."
N18,response_23,"i'm really sorry to hear that you're going through this, but as a artificial intelligence, i can't make a diagnosis. however, i can suggest other possible causes for your pain, such as a hernia, nerve irritation, or even referred pain from elsewhere in the body. 
an inguinal hernia happens when intestine or fat pushes through a weak spot in the wall of your lower abdomen. this protrusion can put pressure on a nerve or on the spermatic cord leading to your testicles, creating discomfort or pain. 
also, sometimes the problem is not where the pain is located, but it's what we call referred pain. in this scenario, a problem in one area of the body causes pain in another, seemingly unrelated, area.
but those are just possibilities. remember to go back to the doctor's as soon as you are able, especially if your symptom worsen. this will help to get an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan."
N18,response_24,"i'm truly sorry to hear about the discomfort you're experiencing. this kind of pain can be very distressing, and even more so if the cause is unknown. i would suggest getting in touch with a urologist when possible or getting a second opinion where they can explore other possible causes. in some cases, intermittent testicular pain can be due to musculoskeletal issues, inguinal hernia, referred pain from other areas (like low back problem), or from nerve irritation (including pudendal neuralgia or ilioinguinal neuralgia).

it's important to mention that testicular torsion can be easily missed, it presented with intermittent episodes of scrotal pain in 50% of cases. so, if the pain persists, and you've followed up with another doctor, please consider returning to the er.

moreover, stress and anxiety can exacerbate perception of pain so do your best to stay calm and take care of your mental health during this time."
N18,response_25,"i'm an ai model developed by openai with the ability to provide general health information but i'm not a doctor.  

testicular pain can have various causes, and it can be difficult to diagnose without a physical examination. you mentioned that torsion, epididymitis, varicocele, cancer, and kidney stones have been ruled out. you also suggested hernia or intermittent testicular torsion as possible causes.

bearing in mind your symptoms and normal exams, as well as your overall health status and no other discernible symptoms, a few other possibilities could be: 

1. hydrocele (fluid accumulation around the testicle, often painless but can cause discomfort), 
2. micro-trauma (after physical activity)
3. orchalgia (chronic testicular pain, often unexplained), 
4. nerve pain (such as from a pinched nerve in your back or groin), 
5. inguinal hernia (typically presents as a bulge in the groin, but sometimes can only cause testicular pain)

without a physical examination and further testing though, it's impossible to tell what the true cause is and these are not comprehensive possibilities.

it's good that you applied for medicaid and va healthcare. both options can be valuable resources. try to arrange a follow-up visit with a urologist or your primary care provider as soon as you can. they can perform a more thorough evaluation and determine if further diagnostic tests (like a ct scan, mri, or blood tests) are needed.

please know that while this is a stressful situation, testicular pain is a common symptom and in many cases it can be managed or alleviated with the right treatment.

remember, if the pain becomes severe or you notice sudden changes, seek emergency medical care. in case you notice redness or swelling, fever, nausea or vomiting, seek prompt medical attention."
