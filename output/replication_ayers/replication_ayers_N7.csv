N7,response_1,"it's difficult to fully answer your question without a complete ear examination, so you should talk to a professional about your suspicion. however, any foreign bodies on or near the eardrum, including hair, can certainly cause discomfort and abnormal sounds. while it's often not possible for actual hair to grow from the ear canal, hair from the outer ear can sometimes find its way inside.

it's not recommended that you try to remove these hairs yourself as the eardrum is delicate and can be damaged easily. you should make an appointment with an otolaryngologist (an ear, nose, and throat specialist) or an audiologist for a professional evaluation and possible removal of the hairs if necessary. it's also possible that there may be other causes for your tinnitus that an ent can help diagnose and treat.

in general, tinnitus is often tied to hearing loss which can be associated with excessive noise exposure, certain medications, and the natural aging process. there are also many other possible causes of tinnitus ranging from benign (like earwax buildup or eustachian tube dysfunction) to more serious medical conditions. so, getting a complete ear evaluation from a professional can help figure out the cause and potential treatment options."
N7,response_2,"it is quite unlikely for a hair to cause tinnitus unless it's causing a very mild level of irritation or discomfort, which may or may not be alleviated by removal. however, it is worth discussing with a health care professional, preferably an otolaryngologist (ent specialist). it would also be important to ascertain that the ""hairs"" truly are a hair and not scarring or other anomalies. 

given that you notice tinnitus modulation with jaw movements and have had previous a previous evaluation for tmj, another possibility could be somatosensory tinnitus, where your somatosensory system (which responds to touch) can influence the level and frequency of your tinnitus. 

treatment in such cases, while still elusive, can vary from physical therapy interventions, dental interventions, cognitive behavioral therapy, among others. 

remember that these are only possibilities and it's important to discuss your symptoms and concerns with a health care professional, preferably an ent specialist or a dentist with expertise in tmj."
N7,response_3,"it is unlikely that the hairs are causing your tinnitus as they are external to the eardrum and would not be affecting the mechanics of sound transmission and perception. they're most likely just hairs from your external auditory canal. while they appear to touch the eardrum on the picture, this might merely be due to the perspective of the shot.

if your tinnitus is bothersome, it might be right to see an ear-nose-throat specialist who can do further evaluations. they might recommend an audiometry to see if there might be any undetected hearing loss, as this might cause tinnitus too.

moreover, it's essential not to poke anything in your ear, even if it seems harmless. the tissue in your ear is incredibly delicate and easily hurt. if you're worried about that hair, an ent can evaluate this as well and propose an appropriate solution. 

remember: tinnitus is a symptom, not a disease itself and often comes from some other underlying condition. therefore, it is essential to find and treat this condition to alleviate your tinnitus.

note: this advice is intended to be general in nature, and specific causes may not apply to your situation. always consult with a healthcare provider for accurate information."
N7,response_4,"your concern is valid, but it's important to remember that tinnitus is a symptom, not a condition itself. it's usually a symptom of an underlying condition, such as age-related hearing loss, ear injury or a circulatory system disorder. 

although it's possible to develop tinnitus as a result of foreign bodies in the external ear canal, the hairs that you see in your otoscope pictures would not typically be the cause of your symptoms. the hairs appear to be located in the external auditory canal, an area filled with naturally occurring hair follicles and cerumen (wax) glands. contact between these hairs and the eardrum would not typically cause tinnitus. 

in normal circumstances, removal of these hairs would not be necessary and attempts to do so could potentially result in ear injury. therefore, it would not be advisable to try and remove them yourself. 

if your symptoms persist, you should consider seeing an otolaryngologist (ear, nose and throat specialist) to further evaluate your ears and explore other potential causes of your symptoms. they would conduct a comprehensive ear, nose and throat examination and may order hearing tests to identify any potential issues.

remember, it's not the purpose of this service to provide a diagnosis, so please consult with a healthcare professional for an appropriate evaluation. 

lastly, remember to not use otoscopes or other devices in the ear without proper training as it could potentially harm your ears."
N7,response_5,"i'm an ai developed by openai and i do not have the ability to view images. however, based on your description, it must be noted that, while having a hair touching the eardrum could potentially be uncomfortable, it is unlikely to cause tinnitus.

tinnitus, or persistent ringing in the ears, is often linked with many different conditions including, but not limited to, hearing loss, loud noise exposure, stress, and various ear disorders. sometimes the exact cause can be hard to identify. 

as for the hair in your ear, it should certainly not be attempted to remove by yourself since this can cause damage to your eardrum or ear canal. 

typically, an ear, nose, and throat doctor (ent) can safely remove anything lodged or out of place within the ear canal. they have special tools and training to do this without causing harm to your ear. 

the fact that modulating your jaw changes the intensity of your tinnitus leads me to believe that it may be tied to your temporomandibular joint (tmj). in some cases, the nerves and muscles of the jaw can affect hearing due to their proximity to your middle and inner ear. 

you mentioned you've already seen a dentist for potential tmj and tried a night guard without success. in this case, you might want to see an audiologist, a professional who specializes in hearing, or an ent specialist. they can conduct more in-depth examinations and tests to help figure out the root cause of your tinnitus. 

remember, this advice is intended to be general in nature, and specific causes may not apply to your situation. always consult with a healthcare provider for accurate information."
N7,response_6,"sorry, but as a language model ai, i can't view or interpret images or look into medical issues directly. it'd be best to approach your doctor with your discoveries. do not try to extract anything from your ear yourself, as it could cause serious damage. even if the hair is touching your eardrum, it doesn't necessarily mean that this is the cause of your tinnitus. tinnitus can be a symptom of a wide range of underlying issues, and are typically associated with hearing loss or damage to the inner ear. it'd be a good idea to consult an ear, nose and throat (ent) specialist about your concerns."
N7,response_7,"i'm an ai trained by openai, not a doctor, but i can tell you that the image does seem to show a couple of hairs touching your left eardrum. this could potentially cause some irritation and sounds. it's difficult to say for sure without a medical degree, and it's also not safe to attempt to remove them yourself.

attempting to remove the hair yourself could cause significant damage to your ear, including perforation of the eardrum or introducing an infection. it's best to consult with a healthcare professional, preferably an ear/nose/throat (ent) specialist, who may be able to safely remove the hairs and offer you more targeted advice.

if the hairs were indeed causing the symptoms, removal should help. but keep in mind, tinnitus is often multifactorial and even if the hairs are contributing, there could be other factors at play like eustachian tube dysfunction, tmj issues or others. the ent specialist can help work through this with you."
N7,response_8,"i'm an ai developed by openai and while i'm not a doctor, i can suggest that you should discuss your findings with a healthcare professional. while it's unlikely that hairs touching the eardrum would cause tinnitus or clicking sounds when you swallow, they could potentially cause itchiness or discomfort.

tinnitus is typically caused by underlying conditions such as age-related hearing loss, exposure to loud noises, or ear disorders like meniere's disease. it may also be related to temporomandibular joint (tmj) disorders, certain medications, high blood pressure, or a build-up of earwax.

the click you hear when you swallow could be due to changing pressures in your middle ear, possible eustachian tube dysfunction, or potentially tmj issues if it's synchronised with your jaw movement.

in regards to the hairs, although you can see them on your camera, it's better not to try to remove these at home. the skin inside your ear canal and your eardrum are very delicate. untrained attempts at removal could cause injury and potentially make your symptoms worse.

it's always best to consult with a healthcare professional for a thorough evaluation. consideringer seeing an ent specialist â€” they have the proper training and equipment to handle situations like this."
N7,response_9,"i'm an ai, not a doctor, but i can tell you that hair touching the eardrum is generally uncommon. given the small size of these hairs, it's also unlikely they are related to your tinnitus. i believe your tinnitus is likely to be due to an issue involving the inner ear or auditory nerve. you should speak to an audiologist or ent specialist who can examine you more closely and perhaps conduct hearing tests or an mri scan to identify the possible cause of your tinnitus. you may want to show your pictures to these specialists, but i stress that you should not attempt to remove these hairs yourself, as damaging the eardrum can cause serious complications. these hairs may simply be strands of cerumen (ear wax), which is normal."
N7,response_10,"you should know that a self-diagnosis base on $20 ear camera from amazon may not be accurate. however, the idea of a hair touching your eardrum causing tinnitus is possible but unlikely. it is more common that it would cause a perceived sensation of tickling or itching, and removing such a hair needs a very delicate process that should be done by a professional. 

you should consult an ent specialist or an audiologist and have a proper clinical examination. they are the ones who are trained and authorized to conduct a comprehensive examination of your ears.

additionally, other background causes of tinnitus should be investigated. if it is related to eustachian tube dysfunction, there are many other treatment paths, beyond nasal steroids, that can be explored. sometimes, physiotherapy, breathing exercises or even surgical intervention might be necessary. treatment of an underlying tmj disorder can be beneficial if present. lastly, cognitive-behavioral treatments can help to manage the stress and distraction that chronic tinnitus can cause.

your weight may be causing sleep apnea, which is a known cause of tinnitus as well. weight loss can significantly improve or eliminate symptoms if sleep apnea is an underlying condition.

to summarize, consult with an ent specialist or audiologist and avoid trying to clean your deep inner ears by yourself, as it can cause damage."
N7,response_11,"while it's great you have taken the initiative to investigate your own symptoms, interpretation of ear images should be left to healthcare professionals who have appropriate training. it is not clear from the pictures that you linked whether the hairs are actually touching your eardrum, and it would be quite unusual for hair to be causing tinnitus by touching the eardrum. 

tinnitus is often linked to damage to the hair cells in the inner ear, not hairs touching the eardrum. real causes of tinnitus include exposure to loud noise, hearing loss due to aging, ototoxic medications, and even certain health conditions such as high blood pressure.

treating tinnitus can be a complex process given it often has multiple potential underlying causes. if your symptoms persist, a formal evaluation by an ear, nose, and throat (ent) specialist would be useful. these specialists, also called otolaryngologists, have the expertise necessary to accurately diagnose and treat ear-related conditions including tinnitus.

keep in mind that sticking anything inside your ear, including a camera or an object to remove a hair, can potentially cause a traumatic injury to your ear and even worsen your tinnitus or cause hearing loss. therefore, i'd recommend you not to try this yourself. if there is indeed a hair in your ear canal touching your eardrum, this should also be evaluated by an ent doctor for correct and safe removal. as always, it is important to not take images or content on the internet as strict medical advice, but as a platform to further discuss symptoms and concerns with a healthcare provider."
N7,response_12,"while this platform does not allow access to the pictures you have attached, in a general sense, having hair inside your ear canal should not cause tinnitus. the eardrum is extremely sensitive and resilient. while it could be irritated if a hair is brushing against it, it's unlikely to cause permanent symptoms such as tinnitus.

tinnitus can be due to many different causes, but it's most often linked to age-related hearing loss, exposure to loud noises, earwax blockages, or changes within your ear bones. other conditions such as tmj, neck and head injuries, or certain types of medications can trigger tinnitus as well.

given this and your reported symptoms of modulation in tinnitus with jaw movement, there may be an underlying cause related to neurophysiological changes or another systemic condition. this would be something a dedicated specialist, like an ent or neurologist, could further evaluate.

in regards to the hair removal, it is highly recommended not to try to self-remove anything in the ear canal. it can potentially cause more damage. if those hairs are indeed in close contact or stuck to the eardrum, it is best to schedule an appointment with an ear, nose and throat (ent) specialist to examine and potentially remove it, if deemed necessary. 

remember, this advice is intended to be general in nature, please consult with your healthcare provider before making any decisions about your health.)"
N7,response_13,"i'm an ai developed by openai, but i can tell you from a medical perspective that hair generally shouldn't be inside your ear canal, much less touching your eardrum. for your own safety, it's recommended that you don't try to remove this yourself, as the eardrum is delicate and can be easily damaged, which could potentially lead to hearing loss or infections. a healthcare professional should ideally perform this kind of procedure.

the presence of a foreign body, like hair, touching the eardrum could potentially explain your tinnitus. however, tinnitus can be caused by a wide variety of issues, including eustachian tube dysfunction, tmj problems, or even certain medications or underlying health conditions.

it's important that you discuss these images with your healthcare provider, as they'll likely want to examine your ear themselves and peerhaps invite an otologist consultation. they might also want to conduct further testing to rule out other potential causes of your symptoms. 

always remember that self diagnosis, even with the help of tools or the internet, isn't a substitute for professional medical advice. although ai technology has made great advances, it's still best to discuss your health concerns with a healthcare provider."
N7,response_14,"it's possible but unlikely that the hairs in your ear are the direct cause of your tinnitus. tinnitus is typically caused by damage to or issues with the nerves in your ear and is more often associated with hearing loss, though it can develop for various other reasons as well. 

in some cases, objects touching the eardrum has led to tinnitus, but these are usually situations where a significant amount of wax or a foreign body has made its way into the ear canal and is putting pressure on the drum. the hair strands (if that's what they are) look very thin and are unlikely to cause the same level of persistent stimulation/irritation, especially because your doctor didn't spot anything out of the ordinary on examination. 

with that said, having something making contact with your eardrum could potentially cause or contribute to your symptoms, particularly if you're very sensitive to irritation in this area. if you would like to have the hairs removed to see if it makes a difference for your tinnitus, please do not attempt to do this yourself. the inner ear is very delicate, and you could cause serious damage. instead, schedule an appointment with an ent (ear, nose, and throat specialist) who can examine your ears more closely and safely remove the hairs if necessary. 

if you continue to experience tinnitus without clear cause, you should consider booking an appointment with an audiologist for a hearing test to rule out any underlying hearing issues. you can also consider cognitive behavioral therapy (cbt), which has been found to help many people with tinnitus. it's also worth considering any other potential factors that could be contributing to your symptoms, such as certain medications or high levels of stress."
N7,response_15,"i'm an ai developed by openai and i can't review your pictures, but i can tell you that the possibility of a hair touching your eardrum causing tinnitus is relatively low. tinnitus is usually due to damage in the cochlea or other parts of the auditory pathway, which can be caused by loud noise exposure, certain medications, aging, etc. 

sometimes, tinnitus can be related to other conditions like tmj or eustachian tube dysfunction or even related to a hair touching the eardrum, but this is less common. 

either way, since you're concerned about this and have been suffering with tinnitus for some time, it would be best to seek an evaluation by an ent specialist and not to attempt to remove anything from your ear yourself, as this could potentially cause more harm. discuss this issue further with your doctor. moreover, it's vital to avoid self-diagnosing and intervene on your own based on information obtained by self-examination kits or devices as they may not provide accurate results and can even be harmful. 

remember, this advice is intended to be general in nature, please consult with healthcare professionals for accurate information."
N7,response_16,"the photos you have posted appear to show strands of hair near or touching your eardrum. indeed, this could potentially be a cause of your tinnitus, especially if these hairs are causing vibrations or irritation of the eardrum.

however, it is also important to understand that tinnitus can be caused by many different reasons, including ear infections, eustachian tube dysfunction, high blood pressure, certain medications, and exposure to loud noises.

i would not recommend trying to remove these hairs yourself as the eardrum is a very delicate structure and you could potentially cause serious damage. it would be preferable to have this done by a professional. please consult a medical professional such as an otolaryngologist (ent specialist) for further investigations and management.

remember, this advice is intended to be general in nature, and specific causes may not apply to your situation. always consult with a healthcare provider for appropriate examination, diagnosis, and treatment."
N7,response_17,"i'm an ai trained by openai, but i've been taught that you should not try to remove anything from your ear on your own, especially not something that might be touching your eardrum, as this could cause serious damage. the eardrum is a very delicate structure and poking or prodding it could cause anything from a minor perforation to a severe rupture, both of which could irreparably harm your hearing. 

while it is interesting that you noticed some hair near your left eardrum, it wouldn't typically be the first thought as a cause for tinnitus. however, that does not mean it is impossible. given the fact that you're experiencing tinnitus in that ear, it would be a good idea to consult an ear, nose, and throat specialist (otolaryngologist). they would have the expertise and special tools to look deeper into this issue.

remember, the primary purpose of earwax is to protect the eardrum and ear canal by trapping dirt and slowing the growth of bacteria. sometimes, things like hair, skin flakes, and other debris can get caught in the earwax and end up near the eardrum, but that doesn't automatically mean they're causing a problem. it could simply be a normal part of how your body maintains your ears. again, an otolaryngologist is best placed to evaluate your situation accurately. 

while tinnitus is frustrating and disconcerting, try not to worry too much. most cases of tinnitus are related to age-related hearing loss, exposure to loud noise, or earwax blockage, and some types can be managed or even resolved with appropriate treatment. in case the tinnitus persists without finding a definitive cause, various coping mechanisms, sound therapies, and even some medications can help manage it."
N7,response_18,"i'm an ai and can't directly view your pictures, but your description is very helpful. however, i would still encourage you to talk to your gp or a specialist about the hairs touching your eardrum.

while it's theoretically possible for a hair on or near your eardrum to cause a tinnitus-like sensation, it's very unlikely. tinnitus is usually due to damage to the hairs in your inner ear, not hairs near or on your eardrum.

don't try to remove the hairs yourself. your ear canal and eardrum are very sensitive. if you accidentally push the hairs deeper into your ear or puncture your eardrum, you could cause more problems.

if the hairs are indeed in contact with your eardrum and you believe they may be causing your tinnitus, schedule an appointment with an ent (ear, nose, and throat) specialist. they'll have the proper tools and training to safely remove the hairs if necessary."
N7,response_19,"i'm an ai and not a doctor, but based on what i've learned, the hairs visible in your images are unlikely to be causing your tinnitus. they are very thin and don't have the strength to stimulate the eardrum to cause tinnitus.  the movement you notice may be due to a condition called eustachian tube dysfunction (etd), which your gp has talked about. this causes airflow problems between your middle ear and the area behind your nose. 

the noisy tinnitus, lack of response to treatment, and clicking sound when you swallow sound more like symptoms of etd. nasal steroids often provide relief from this, but if they haven't worked for you, you might want to discuss other treatment options with your gp. 

there are a few conditions that may cause tinnitus, and the exact diagnosis is often hard to give. if the symptoms persist or get worse, you should see an ent or audiologist for an evaluation. it's recommended not to try to remove the hairs by yourself as it might hurt more or cause an infection if not done properly. 

remember, this advice is intended to be general in nature, and specific causes may not apply to your situation. always consult with a healthcare provider for appropriate examination, diagnosis and treatment."
N7,response_20,"while it's possible that the hairs you're seeing could trigger irritating sounds, it's highly unlikely that they are the primary cause of your tinnitus. tinnitus is typically associated with damage to the inner ear, where sound is detected, not the ear drum. 

most cases of tinnitus are caused by damage to the cells in the cochlea, a part of the inner ear. this damage can be brought on by exposure to loud noise, ear infections, certain medication, or natural aging. the tinnitus is a product of these damaged cells sending signals to the brain even when no sounds are present.

the clicking you feel while swallowing is usually related to the muscles and joints in the middle ear, and typically has nothing to do with the eardrum or the hairs that you are seeing.

while this is the typical case, i would recommend seeing an otolaryngologist (also known as an ear, nose and throat doctor, or ent) for further evaluation. they specialize in these types of issues and might have other recommendations or treatments. please do not attempt to remove the hairs on your own, as this could lead to ear damage or infection."
N7,response_21,"i'm an ai trained in medical information retrieval. while i can't directly interpret your images, i can say that even the best ear cleaning practices can sometimes miss a stray hair or two. they can actually enter your ear canal quite easily - for example, each time you dry your ears with a towel after showering, you could be introducing some hair into your ears without even knowing it!

typically, a few stray hairs are harmless and will eventually move out of your ear naturally. that said, the inside of our ears are very sensitive. the ear drum (tympanic membrane) in particular can be sensitive to anything touching it.

if there's a hair in direct contact with your eardrum, it could irritate it, creating unusual sounds. this might be what you're experiencing as tinnitus. if it's a stray hair causing your problem, the body should naturally move it out of your ear over time. but if it's persisting, it might need to be professionally removed. 

do not try to remove it yourself! this could potentially lead to an ear injury. please consult with an ent (ear-nose-throat) specialist. they can safely remove anything that shouldn't be there and can also provide further advice or treatment for your chronic tinnitus.

please note this is a computer-generated response based on the information you provided and might not be wholly accurate. it's always best to consult with a healthcare professional on such matters!"
N7,response_22,"while it's unlikely that the hair follicles in your ear are causing the symptoms you are experiencing, it's possible that they could be contributing to the sensation of tinnitus and discomfort. it's equally possible that they are not related at all. ear hair has been implicated in tinnitus cases before, but usually when in extreme excess and more commonly when it comes in direct contact with the eardrum.

importantly, not every professional agrees on this point. the hair seen in your picture could certainly be in contact with your eardrum, but it may or may not be causing your tinnitus. symptoms that can be modulated by movement of the jaw, or worsen when eating or talking, are more typically associated with temporomandibular joint disorder (tmj).

please consult an otolaryngologist (ear, nose, and throat doctor), to examine your ear under the microscope, diagnose the condition properly and guide you to the proper treatment if required. you should definitely not attempt to remove or tamper with anything in the ear canal or near the eardrum by yourself, as this can lead to severe injuries and potentially permanent hearing loss."
N7,response_23,"it's hard to be sure from a photograph, but the ""hairs"" you're seeing are likely not actual hairs that strayed into your ear from your scalp. rather, they could be strands of cerumen (earwax) or, possibly, the cilia, or tiny hair-like structures that line the ear canal and help to carry wax and debris out of the ear.

it's unlikely that these are causing your tinnitus, as they are a normal part of your ear's anatomy and function. tinnitus is usually caused by damage to the structures of the inner earâ€”a part of the ear you can't see without specialized equipmentâ€”or by underlying health conditions like age-related hearing loss, ear injury or a circulatory system disorder.

the clicks you're hearing when you swallow might indeed be due to eustachian tube dysfunction, as your gp suggested. this condition happens when the small tube that links your throat to your middle ear becomes blocked, changing the air pressure in your ear. the clicking or popping that you hear is a common symptom.

if you're still concerned, i would suggest you make an appointment with an ent specialist, who can perform a more thorough examination and, if necessary, further tests to identify the cause of your symptoms. 

but in the meantime, you should stop using the ear cleaning kit. manipulating the ear canal and eardrum on your own with a camera or any other device can cause infection or even injury to the ear, which could exacerbate your tinnitus symptoms or cause other problems. and don't try to remove the ""hairs"" â€“ you're more likely to push them further in and cause a blockage or damage something."
N7,response_24,"yes, hairs in the ear canal could potentially cause symptoms like tinnitus or a clicking sound, especially if they are touching the eardrum. however, this is quite a rare occurrence. it's important not to try and remove these hairs yourself as you may accidentally damage your ear or eardrum.

in your situation, i would recommend that you see an ent (ear, nose, and throat) specialist. they can conduct a more thorough examination of your ears and, if necessary, safely remove the hairs. 

additionally, they can also confirm if the hairs are indeed the cause of your symptoms or if there is another underlying condition that needs to be treated. please do not use q-tips or any other tools to try to remove the hairs yourself.

in the meantime, if your tinnitus is causing significant distress, there are many coping techniques and therapies that can help manage the symptom until you can see a specialist. these can include using a white noise machine, practicing mindfulness or relaxation techniques, or using hearing aids which are specifically designed to help with tinnitus. 

please consult with your healthcare practitioner before starting any treatments for your symptoms."
N7,response_25,"as an ai language model, i can provide some general advice, but it is always crucial to consult a medical professional for an accurate diagnosis.

the hairs you see in the latter image might just be fine hair from the external ear canal and may not be the cause of your tinnitus. it's also important to consider that it's pretty unusual for hair to reach the eardrum, considering the structure and curves of the ear canal.

most commonly, tinnitus is caused by damage to the inner ear or related nerve pathways. hearing loss, loud noise exposure, certain medications, and some medical conditions can cause or increase the likelihood of developing tinnitus.

concerning the clicking sound you hear when you swallow, that could be related to the eustachian tube function (like your gp suggested), or it might also be related to myoclonus, a condition where the muscles in the middle ear contract irregularly, causing sounds that may resemble a click. 

the point here is - while the picture is certainly interesting, it's unlikely to provide an definitive explanation for your symptoms. you should consult an otolaryngologist (ear, nose, and throat specialist - ent) for further evaluation and management.

please note: this advice is intended to be general in nature, and specific causes may not apply to your situation. always consult with a healthcare provider for appropriate examinations, treatment, testing, and care recommendations."
