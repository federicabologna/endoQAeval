the diagnosis of meningitis aligns with these symptoms, as it can cause high fever, headache, sensitivity to light, confusion, and other neurological symptoms. difficulty breathing can also occur, although it's less typical. 

the good news is that once diagnosed, most types of meningitis can be treated effectively with antibiotics and supportive care. recovery, like the disease itself, varies from person to person, and will generally take time and rest. it's important for her to follow her doctor's advice and take the full course of antibiotics.

your quick action in seeking medical help could have been life-saving. even though she has a tough struggle ahead in recovery, you have done the right thing to get her the best help possible.
