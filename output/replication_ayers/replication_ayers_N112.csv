N112,response_1,"the d-dimer test is a blood test often used to help check for or monitor blood clotting problems. a positive test means the d-dimer level in your body is higher than normal and suggests that there might be significant blood clotting going on in your body. however, this is not always the case and the test is not definitive. a d-dimer level of less than 150 ng/ml is considered to be within the normal range, which suggests that there is no significant formation or breakdown of clots in your body at this time. therefore, a value of <150 ng/ml is equivalent to a negative result. always consult with your personal healthcare provider for personalized advice."
N112,response_2,"the d-dimer test looks for fibrin degradation products, essentially the ""junk"" that's left over after your body breaks down a blood clot. if the level is high, that suggests there might be an active clot somewhere. if you have a low d-dimer, that suggests there is no active clotting process going on. for reference, a result of less than 500 ng/ml is often considered normal. 

less than 150 ng/ml is a negative result, meaning that it is very unlikely that you have an active clot. so to make it clear: your result is ""negative"" in the sense that it doesn't suggest the presence of a clot, which is good. however, d-dimer levels can be elevated for a lot of reasons, including inflammation and infection, so it's not a definitive test; it is more of a rule-out test, meaning if it's negative, clotting issues can mostly be ruled out. 

it seems like your healthcare providers have been thorough in evaluating you and are taking appropriate steps to make sure they aren't missing anything. seeing a cardiologist for further evaluation is a good course of action given your recent health history. i hope you start feeling better soon!"
N112,response_3,"d-dimer is a blood test often used to rule out the presence of a serious blood clot. d-dimer levels may rise in many conditions, but a very high level of d-dimer is often seen in deep vein thrombosis (dvt), pulmonary embolism (pe) or disseminated intravascular coagulation (dic).

in your case, a d-dimer result of less than 150 ng/ml is considered as negative, meaning it's very unlikely that you have a blood clot in your leg (dvt) or the lungs (pe). 

different labs use different range because of the variety of testing methods, but usually a level of less than 500 ng/ml (or 0.5 μg/ml) is considered as normal/negative. 

your troponin level is also normal. troponin is a protein found in the heart muscle cells, and gets released when these cells are injured (like in a heart attack). a high troponin level may indicate some heart damage.

remember, these tests are not 100% accurate and clinical correlation is always needed. since you will be seeing an ep cardiologist soon, they will consider your symptoms, medical history and these results all together for your diagnosis and management. 

it's good that you are following up on your symptoms even with the negative tests, as sometimes further investigation may be needed to find out what's causing your symptoms. 

keep in good communication with your doctor and follow all their advice. also, do not hesitate to share all your worries and concerns with them. they are there to help you."
N112,response_4,"the d-dimer test is a type of blood test that is often used to determine if a person has a significant blood clot. the body produces d-dimer when a blood clot dissolves in the body. high levels of d-dimer can indicate that a person has a significant blood clot.

in your case, a d-dimer result of <150 ng/ml is generally considered to be normal or negative. this means the level of d-dimer in your blood is less than 150 nanograms per milliliter, which typically indicates that you do not have a significant blood clot. 

however, d-dimer levels can also increase with age, inflammation, or trauma. so if there is still a strong suspicion for a clot, further evaluation may be needed. 

the troponin level of 0.000 is also considered within normal range. troponin is a protein that is normally seen in the blood after damage to the heart muscle, such as during a heart attack. 

keep in mind that while these results can provide reassurance, they are just part of the overall clinical picture and it’s best to discuss with your doctor in conjunction with symptoms and physical exam findings."
N112,response_5,"d-dimer is a blood test that can be used to help rule out the presence of an inappropriate blood clot (thrombus) in your body. normally, d-dimer levels in the blood are rather low; anything less than 250 ng/ml is considered a normal/significantly negative result. hence, your d-dimer level of <150 ng/ml is well within the normal range, meaning that the chance of you currently having a significant blood clot is very low.

the d-dimer result is not typically reported as 0.000 like troponin because they are different types of tests measuring different substances in the blood. troponin is a protein that becomes elevated in the blood when there is damage to the heart muscle, while d-dimer is a protein fragment that becomes elevated when there's significant clotting in the body. the way the results are reported might be different, but the key point is that both your d-dimer and troponin levels are reassuringly low.

your cardiologist visit should further clarify your recent episodes, but from what you've provided, there's little indication of ongoing clot or heart issues."
N112,response_6,"d-dimer is a blood test that measures a substance that is released when a blood clot breaks up. doctors order the d-dimer test, along with other tests and procedures, to check whether you have a blood clot.

d-dimer levels are typically less than 500 nanograms per milliliter (ng/ml). a result of less than 150 ng/ml is considered normal and typically indicates no clot is present. the value of less than 150 ng/ml in your case, along with the normal leg ultrasound, suggests that there's a very low likelihood of a clot.

it's different from troponin which is a heart muscle protein that rises in case of heart muscle damage like in a heart attack. so, your d-dimer and troponin don't have to be 0.000 to be considered normal, they have different reference ranges as they are different types of tests measuring different things. 

however, your symptoms like being winded are important and should be evaluated further by your doctors, possibly with a holter monitor and other tests as they deem necessary. follow-up with your ep cardiologist as advised and discuss your symptoms and result details."
N112,response_7,"in most hospitals, a d-dimer level of less than 500 ng/ml is considered normal. therefore, your value of less than 150 ng/ml indicates that you do not have an abnormal amount of blood clots in your body. the d-dimer test does not say exactly where clots might be, only that the body is trying to dissolving blood clots at a higher than normal rate. it also doesn't specifically identify clots, but shows that clot breakdown products are present in the body.

it's a different measurement to troponin, so it won't be expressed as 0.000 like your troponin level was. the tests are looking for different things -- troponin measures heart muscle damage, while d-dimer looks for evidence of clot breakdown.

talk through all of this with your ep cardiologist at your appointment, but in relation to your initial concerns of blood clots, the measurements from the d dimer test you've provided are considered normal and suggest a lower risk."
N112,response_8,"d-dimer tests are often used to help check for or monitor conditions that cause blood clots. d-dimer is a type of protein produced when a blood clot gets dissolved in the body. it is usually undetectable or detectable at very low levels unless the body is forming and breaking down blood clots.

a normal d-dimer level is less than 500 ng/ml. a level above 500 ng/ml suggests that there may be significant clot formation and breakdown. your result of <150 ng/ml indicates that your d-dimer level is less than 150 ng/ml, which is within the normal range. so it's ""negative"" in a sense that it suggests there aren't any significant clot formation and breakdown happening.

troponin test measures the levels of certain proteins called troponins in the blood. these proteins are released when the heart muscle has been damaged, such as occurs with a heart attack. the more damage there is to the heart, the greater the amount of troponin will be in the blood. therefore, a result of 0.000 for a troponin test effectively counts as 'negative' for heart damage.

your results seem normal, but it's important to discuss with your doctor to understand your health better."
N112,response_9,"the d-dimer test is a blood test often used to help check for or monitor blood clotting problems. a positive d-dimer result may indicate the presence of an abnormally high level of fibrin degradation products. most often, this means that there may be significant blood clot (thrombus) formation and breakdown in the body, but it doesn’t tell where or why. typically, a negative (<500 ng/ml) or a normal d-dimer result means that a blood clot is probably not present.

your d dimer results are <150 ng/ml which is considered negative for the presence of any abnormal clot formation. it is actually well below the cutoff so it is a reassuring result. 

different lab tests use different measurements; for troponin and d-dimers, the measurements aren't the same so one test result can't be directly compared to another.

as for your arrhythmia, it seems appropriate that your ep cardiologist will do further testing, like a holter monitor to capture any more instances of psvt or any other abnormal heart rhythms. nonetheless, always adhere to the advice provided by your physician."
N112,response_10,"d-dimer is a protein fragment that is produced when a blood clot dissolves in the body. it's usually undetectable or present at very low levels unless the body is breaking down blood clots.

a negative d-dimer result (less than 500 ng/ml) suggests that it is less likely there are blood clots in the body. your result of <150 ng/ml is considered lower than the threshold, meaning it's a negative result - which is a good news as it largely rules out the presence of an elevated coagulation state that could lead to blood clots.

it doesn't necessarily have to read 0.000 as no test is perfect and some d-dimer may be detected in the absence of clots due to other reasons such as inflammation, trauma, pregnancy, cancer, liver disease, recent surgery, and even advanced age.

it seems that, based on your test results, blood clots are not likely causing your symptoms. but follow-up with your cardiologist is an excellent idea to further investigate any possible cardiac causes of your symptoms, especially given your recent history of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (psvt)."
N112,response_11,"the d-dimer is a blood test that can be used to help rule out a serious blood clot, like deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism. the test measures a substance in blood that's released when a clot breaks up. when the d-dimer level is elevated it can indicate that there might be significant blood clot (thrombus) formation and breakdown in the body. however, a negative d-dimer result (less than a certain threshold) can suggest that a deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism is less likely. the typical range for d-dimer is 0 to 500 ng/ml. so, your value of <150 ng/ml is less than the threshold that is generally considered significant, suggesting a lower probability of having a clot. this however, does not entirely rule out a clot and is often used in combination with other tests and clinical judgement.

troponin levels in the blood are measured to determine if a heart attack has occurred since they rise when there is damage to the heart muscle. unlike d-dimer, troponin test doesn't have a definitive negative value and it varies among individuals and labs, but typically, values below 0.04 ng/ml are considered normal.

therefore, your d-dimer value of &lt;150 ng/ml and troponin of 0.000 suggest that you are unlikely to have a significant blood clot or heart muscle damage at the time when the tests were done. 

please consult your doctor to understand all this in the context of your symptoms and specific clinical situation."
N112,response_12,"a d-dimer test measures the level of d-dimer, a small protein fragment present in the blood after a blood clot is degraded by fibrinolysis. a level of less than 500 ng/ml is generally considered normal. 

with your d-dimer level being below 150 ng/ml, this signifies that it is unlikely you have a current condition that leads to significant blood clot formation and breakdown.

in other words, your d-dimer level is low/negative, as expected in healthy individuals, or in those who do not have a significant blood clot. however, the negative result doesn't definitively rule out a clot, and it should be interpreted in the context of your overall clinical condition.

the troponin level is a different measurement that is usually used to help diagnose heart attacks. your level of 0.000 is essentially undetectable which also represents a negative result. different laboratories might express these results in different ways, but both your results seem to be within normal limits. 

please consult with your doctor or a specialist for a conclusive diagnosis and treatment."
N112,response_13,"a d-dimer test measures the amount of d-dimer, a protein fragment, in your blood. this protein is produced when a blood clot dissolves. higher levels of d-dimer may suggest that there are significant blood clot(s) in the formation and breakdown stages in your body. the ranges can depend on the lab, but generally a d-dimer level of less than 500 ng/ml is considered to be normal and indicates that it is less likely that there are significant blood clot(s) in your body. 

your result of <150 ng/ml means that your d-dimer level was less than 150 ng/ml, which is well within the range that is generally considered normal. this suggests it is unlikely that there is any significant clot formation in your body. the expression in numbers just means that your level was somewhere below 150 ng/ml - they probably didn't measure the exact level because it was sufficiently low for them to rule out clotting issues. 

so, your d-dimer result, along with the normal leg ultrasound, strongly suggests that you don't have any significant clots, particularly in your legs which can cause pain and shortness of breath if they travel to your lungs (a condition called pulmonary embolism). 

continue to work closely with your doctor and cardiologist to manage your symptoms and condition. it's great that you're planning to see an electrophysiologist since they specialize in heart rhythm issues like psvt. remember, if you have any worsening symptoms or new concerns, don't hesitate to seek immediate medical attention."
N112,response_14,"d-dimer is a blood test that can be used to help rule out the presence of a serious blood clot. when you get a blood clot, your body sets off a process called fibrinolysis to break the clot down. the d-dimer test measures the amount of d-dimer in your blood, which can indicate that fibrinolysis has taken place.

d-dimer values are commonly reported as less than or equal to a certain cutoff value, below which there is a high likelihood that a thrombus (a blood clot that forms inside a blood vessel) is not present. the typical cutoff value depends on the specific assay used but is usually less than or equal to 500 ng/ml.

in your case, the d dimer result of <150 ng/ml is below the usual cutoff value, which would be quite reassuring and would make it unlikely that you have a clot.

it doesn't mean the same as 0.000 as the troponin since these are different markers and represent different things. a troponin level of 0.000 is a normal finding which means that there is no evidence of damage to your heart muscle, whereas a d dimer of <150 ng/ml means there's no evidence of abnormal clotting activity going on in the body.

always consult with your doctor for interpretation of your test results."
N112,response_15,"d-dimer is a small protein fragment present in the blood after a blood clot is degraded by fibrinolysis. it's one of the markers we use to help rule out clotting disorders such as deep vein thrombosis (dvt) or pulmonary embolism (pe). 

typically, a d-dimer level of less than 500 ng/ml ddu is taken as a negative result, which means that it's unlikely that there are significant levels of clotting activity occurring in your body. in your case, the test result of less than 150 ng/ml suggests that you don't have a dvt or pe currently. 

as for the comparison with troponin, they are two different tests that measure different things. troponin is a marker of heart muscle damage, while d-dimer measures the presence of blood clot degradation. the ""0.000"" troponin result is not comparable with the ""<150 ng/ml"" d-dimer result. 

when it comes to health concerns or understanding your test result, it's best to consult with a healthcare professional. seeing a cardiologist as you plan will hopefully provide a clear interpretation of your health status."
N112,response_16,"d-dimer is a blood test used to help rule out the presence of an inappropriate blood clot (thrombus). the d-dimer test measures the amount of a protein in your blood which is released when a blood clot dissolves in your body. high levels can suggest an increased likelihood of a blood clot. generally, d-dimer normal ranges can vary depending on the lab but typically a result of less than 500 ng/ml is considered normal.

your d-dimer result of less than 150 ng/ml would therefore be considered normal, i.e. it suggests there is not a high likelihood of a clot. it does not have to read 0.000 to be considered negative. because the d-dimer test can be positive in several situations, it is mainly used to rule out disease rather than confirm it. a negative (normal) d-dimer result generally signifies that it is unlikely a clot is present (although it does not guarantee that a clot does not exist).

please do discuss further with your healthcare provider or cardiologist particularly in regard of your recent symptoms and history of psvt and leg pain. they will be best equipped to interpret these lab results in the context of your clinical picture and decide upon the need for further tests and management plans.

in addition, continue to monitor your symptoms and seek immediate medical attention if they worsen such as experiencing worsening windedness or leg pain, or new symptoms such as chest pain, breathlessness or fainting episodes."
N112,response_17,"a d-dimer test is used to check if you might have a blood clot. the normal range for d-dimer levels is <500 ng/ml. a d-dimer result of less than 500 ng/ml is considered normal and is generally indicative of a negative result -- meaning it's less likely that there are significant blood clots.

in your case, a value of <150 ng/ml is considered normal as it is lower than 500 ng/ml. this is a negative result, meaning it is less likely that you have conditions associated with high d-dimer levels such as deep vein thrombosis (dvt), pulmonary embolism (pe), or disseminated intravascular coagulation (dic).

please note that the d-dimer test is not 100% accurate and there could be other reasons for increased levels. always consult with your healthcare provider for accurate information."
N112,response_18,"the d-dimer is a blood test that can be used to help rule out the presence of a serious blood clot, such as deep vein thrombosis (dvt), pulmonary embolism (pe), or stroke. it does this by measuring the amount of d-dimer, a protein fragment, in your blood. 

in your case, a value of <150 ng/ml is considered negative (normal). this means there's likely no significant clotting happening in your body. d-dimer levels are typically raised to >500 ng/ml in people with a significant blood clot.

it's important to remember, though, that d-dimer values can be raised for many reasons, including infection, inflammation, surgery, or injury, so alone it cannot confirm or exclude a clot.

your troponin levels (0.000) are the measure of a protein released when heart muscle is damaged. a rising level of troponin is one indication of a heart attack. in your case, an undetectable level would suggest no heart damage.

given your symptoms and history having an ep cardiologist evaluate you is a good idea, particularly if you continue to experience unusual symptoms. be sure to keep them informed about all symptoms and previous test results."
N112,response_19,"d-dimer is a test that measures the amount of a specific substance that is released when a blood clot breaks down. a d-dimer value of <150 ng/ml is considered normal and typically indicates that it is unlikely there is a clotting issue.

the d-dimer result is not read the same way as the troponin test. troponin is a protein found in heart muscle. measurements of troponin are used to help diagnose heart attacks if there's a sudden blockage of a coronary artery. a normal troponin level should indeed be very close to zero.

in your case, the d-dimer test is showing a normal result (<150 ng/ml) and indicating that it is unlikely that you are currently experiencing an issue with blood clots. your troponin level is also normal, indicating no recent damage to the heart muscle. 

however, everyone is unique and it's always best to discuss your individual test results with your healthcare provider. this information is designed as an informational guide and should not replace medical consultation. it's great that you're following up with a cardiologist who can provide personalized advice based on your entire clinical picture."
N112,response_20,"d-dimer is a protein fragment produced when a blood clot dissolves in the body. a high d-dimer level suggests a clot is breaking up somewhere in your body, which may indicate a blood clotting disorder.

generally a d-dimer level under 500 ng/ml suggests a clot is unlikely. since your d-dimer is <150 ng/ml, it is well below the cut-off point, thus the likelihood of a clot is low. in this context, a lower d-dimer is better and it reduces the likelihood of dangerous clotting disorders such as deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism. 

as for your troponin level, troponin is a protein released into your bloodstream when your heart muscle has been damaged, such as might happen during a heart attack. a troponin level of 0.000 suggests no heart muscle damage, which again is good news. 

each lab has slightly different reference ranges for the results they report, hence the different ways of expressing the levels. 

you should continue to follow up with your electrophysiologist as they are the best placed person to tell you what all these results mean specifically for you in your situation given what they know about your medical history and cardiology investigations and treatments. but in general terms, these results are reassuring and suggest no current evidence of clot or heart muscle damage as of the time the tests were done."
N112,response_21,"the d-dimer is a lab test that measures the amount of a specific protein (fibrin degradation product) released when blood clots dissolve in the body. a high level of d-dimer can indicate that there are significant blood clots in the body. 

a d-dimer result of less than 150 ng/ml, which is your result, is considered normal and negative for clotting problems. it suggests you have a low probability of a blood clot. it doesn't need to be 0.00 to be negative, different labs use different reference ranges, but generally, anything below 250 or 500 ng/ml (depending on the lab) is usually considered normal. so your d-dimer value is perfectly normal, suggesting no clots.

it is important to keep in mind that while d-dimer is a useful test, it's not 100% accurate, and it can be elevated in many conditions aside from a clot like inflammation, infection, cancer, recent surgery, and even pregnancy. always refer to your doctor's advice as they have the complete picture.

with your cardiac background, it's good to be followed up by an ep cardiologist as suggested. holter monitor could be useful to record your heart's activity and detect anything missed during regular ekg."
N112,response_22,"d-dimer is a molecule released into the blood when a blood clot dissolves in the body. the normal range should be less than 250 ng/ml. therefore, your d-dimer level of less than 150 ng/ml is within the normal range and low, making it highly unlikely you're experiencing deep vein thrombosis (dvt) or a pulmonary embolism (pe). it doesn't mean 0 because d-dimer is typically present in the bloodstream in low concentrations. 

the fact that your d-dimer is elevated can simply be due to recent illness, inflammation, or even undergoing medical procedures, like surgeries.

different tests measure substances in the blood differently. thus, it's important to remember that tests showing negative or 0 are not all equal and depend on the substance being measured. as for your troponin levels, troponin is a protein released into the blood when there is damage to the heart muscle. your level of 0.000 suggests you are not currently experiencing damage to your heart muscle. 

please discuss these results further with your cardiologist for more clarity and guidance on your specific situation."
N112,response_23,"the d-dimer measurement is a blood test typically used to help rule out the presence of an inappropriate blood clot (thrombus). your d-dimer level at less than 150 ng/ml is generally considered to be normal. the d-dimer test measures the amount of a protein that's left over when your blood clots. but this test is not definitive, and its results are often nonspecific because elevated levels can be seen in other conditions such as inflammation, trauma, pregnancy, cancer etc.

similar to d-dimer, troponin levels are reported in numbers. troponin is a heart-specific protein that signals damage to the heart muscle. your value of 0.000 shows no evidence of heart damage, which is a good result. 

your d-dimer and troponin results, together with the normal leg ultrasound, seems to rule out both blood clots in your leg and heart muscle damage. however, please discuss these results with your doctor, who can interpret them based on your specific medical history and current symptoms."
N112,response_24,"a d-dimer is a protein fragment that can be found in the blood after a blood clot is dissolved. it's often used in medicine to rule out dangerous conditions like deep vein thrombosis (blood clot in the leg) or pulmonary embolism (blood clot in the lung). 

the typical threshold for a positive d-dimer test is >500 ng/ml. thus, in your case, a result of <150 ng/ml is read as less than 150 ng/ml; thus, it is below the threshold indicating a negative test. this suggests that it is unlikely you have a blood clot.

regarding the difference in the way the numbers are expressed, it's simply due to different units of measurement used for different tests. they do not mean anything in and of themselves. 

please discuss any concerns or questions you have with your doctor."
N112,response_25,"the value of d-dimer quoted in your post (&lt;150 ng/ml) refers to a level which is lower than 150 nanograms per milliliter. d-dimer tests are used to help rule out the presence of an inappropriate blood clot (thrombus).

the level of d-dimer in the blood may significantly rise when a clot is forming and the body is trying to break it down. thus, a negative (i.e. low) d-dimer level indicates that it is very unlikely that a blood clot is present. in most contexts and testing platforms, a level &lt;500 ng/ml is regarded as negative.

regarding the precise cut-off value, this can vary somewhat between different laboratories and different testing methods, so it is important that the result is interpreted in the clinical context by the healthcare provider who ordered it. 

however, in your case, a d-dimer of &lt;150 ng/ml is certainly very low and strongly suggests the absence of a clot. yet, as you may know, no test is perfect, so if your symptoms persist, do not hesitate to seek further medical advice. 

as for your troponin level, it appears to be within the normal range, which is a good sign since elevated levels can indicate heart damage. 

please remember to discuss all of this with your cardiologist during your upcoming visit."
