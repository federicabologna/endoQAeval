N135,response_1,"risk of sexually transmitted infections (stis) increases with unprotected and multiple exposures. even if you have had unprotected sex before, it does not guarantee that you will not get an sti in the future. each instance of unprotected sex increases your risk. just because you were not infected the last time, does not mean you will be safe next time. 

if you both get tested and both are negative for any stis, you could continue having unprotected sex (assuming you have other birth control methods in place if pregnancy is not desired). however, please remember that some stis can take a while to show up on tests and some are just not curable. almost all are, at the very least, treatable but prevention is always better. 

if condoms cause discomfort, alternate methods of protection like female condoms, dental dams, or using lubes etc may be helpful. additionally, consider seeing a healthcare provider about the discomfort caused by condoms; it could be a latex allergy or sensitivity that can be managed with alternative materials. 

it's always important to discuss these concerns with a healthcare provider who can provide accurate information and help you come up with a safe sex plan that takes into account your personal preferences and needs."
N135,response_2,"yes, the risk of getting a sexually transmitted infection (sti) increases with each unprotected sexual encounter. if the person you're having sex with carries a sti, the chances of transmission occur with each exposure to their bodily fluids. even if you've already had unprotected sex once, that doesn't mean you're now immune or safe from contracting stis in future encounters. it's always best to use some form of protection to mitigate these risks. if condoms are uncomfortable for you, consider other types of protection or sti testing for you and your partner. this information should always be verified with a healthcare professional."
N135,response_3,"the risk of contracting a sexually transmitted infection (sti) increases each time you have unprotected sex. even if you've had unprotected sex with that person before and have not gotten an sti, that doesn't necessarily mean you won't in the future. this person’s sti status could change if they have unprotected sex with others who might be infected. if condoms tend to hurt you, consider other forms of protection such as dental dams, female condoms, or using lubricants to reduce discomfort. always consider getting regularly tested for stis and asking your partner to do the same. it's crucial to maintain open communication about sexual health with your partner. 

please note, this does not cover any risks associated with unplanned pregnancies. you should consult with a healthcare professional or a sex health clinic for personalized advice regarding this situation."
N135,response_4,"yes, the risk of contracting or transmitting sexually transmitted infections (stis) increases with each instance of unprotected sex. 

stis are caused by bacteria, viruses, and protozoa, which can be transmitted through body fluids during unprotected sex. so, each act of unprotected sex presents a new opportunity for those pathogens to pass from one person to another. stis can't be transmitted just once; exposure to the causative agents is possible each time you have unprotected sex, hence it is critical to use protection every time.

get tested as soon as possible to know your sti status and also inform your partner. have open and honest discussions about sexual health with your partner, and consider other forms of protection if condoms cause discomfort. there are other options like dental dams, female condoms, or perhaps non-latex condoms if you're allergic to latex. discuss with a healthcare provider about possible sensitivity or allergy, they can provide alternatives or solutions. 

now, regarding pregnancy, if you are not on any form of birth control, there's also a chance you could get pregnant from unprotected sex. consider discussing with your doctor about finding a birth control method that works best for you."
N135,response_5,"yes, the risk of sexually transmitted infections (stis) increases with unprotected sex. the more times you have unprotected sex, the higher your risk of contracting or spreading an sti. it's important to remember that even one instance of unprotected sex can lead to an sti, so it's always better to play it safe and use some form of protection. if condoms cause discomfort, you could explore other protective methods like female condoms, dental dams or, depending on the nature of your relationship, both of you could get tested for stis to ensure safety. regular check-ups and open communication with your sexual partner(s) can greatly reduce your risks. it’s always recommended to seek medical or professional advice on this matter."
N135,response_6,"the probability of contracting a sexually transmitted infection (sti) does increase with each instance of unprotected sex. however, even one instance of unprotected sex can lead to contracting an sti. if you are aware that your partner has an sti, it's crucial that precautions are taken to protect both parties. if your partner's sexual health status is unknown, it's still important to use protection to minimize the risk. 

if condoms cause discomfort, it's worth exploring different types, brands, or sizes of condoms. a visit to a healthcare provider could also help provide alternatives such as birth control or other protective methods. 

if you have already had unprotected sex, it would be wise to both get tested as soon as possible, as many stis can be asymptomatic but still remain transmissible. 

remember, there's no such thing as being too safe, especially when it comes to your health."
N135,response_7,"yes, the probability of contracting an sti definitely increases with repeated unprotected sex. the fact that you have already had unprotected sex once does not necessarily mean that you have contracted an sti, but continuing with unprotected sex would definitely put you at risk. 

even if you might not experience severe discomfort from condoms, consider other protection methods such as female condoms, dental dams or even low dose contraceptive pills to help minimize the risk of contracting stis and unplanned pregnancies. 

of course, it also depends on your partner's sexual health - it's important to have an open conversation about it and ensure both of you get tested regularly. 

this is also a great opportunity to foster a health talk with your healthcare provider about birth control and protection methods that might work better for you without causing discomfort."
N135,response_8,"yes, the risk of stis does increase with each unprotected sexual act. some stis can be spread through a single exposure, while others might require multiple exposures. the more times you put yourself at risk (i.e., unprotected sex), the higher the probability you will contract an sti if your partner has one. it's recommended to get tested for stis and to consult a healthcare professional regarding appropriate and comfortable condom usage or about exploring other safe-sex options."
N135,response_9,"yes, continuing to have unprotected sex can increase your risk of contracting sexually transmitted infections (stis). each sexual encounter carries its own risk, and the risk accumulates over time. this is because every sexual act can provide an opportunity for an sti to transmit. if he is infected with an sti and you both continue to have unprotected sex, your chances of contracting the sti increase. 

regardless of previous exposure, it's always best to use protection for each separate encounter to reduce the risk of sti transmission, even if condoms are uncomfortable for you. you may want to look into other forms of barrier protection, like internal (female) condoms or dental dams, which could be more comfortable for you. 

if you're in a monogamous relationship and both of you have been tested and cleared of stis, the risk diminishes. however, always remember that even in monogamous relationships, the risk of unintended pregnancy exists when not using contraception. 

please consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice, and consider getting sti tests for both of you due to this recent condom breakage incident to ensure yours and your partner's health."
N135,response_10,"the risk of contracting an sti does increase with each sexual encounter without protection. there's no guarantee that you would have contracted an sti from the initial encounter when the condom broke, so continuing unprotected sex could possibly expose you to an infection. your sexual partner should get tested to ensure they are sti-free before you decide to continue having unprotected sex. please speak with your healthcare provider about this, who might recommend safer alternatives to condoms that would not cause you pain. you might also want to consider other forms of contraception to prevent unwanted pregnancy."
N135,response_11,"your risk for stis does increase with unprotected sex. if both you and your partner have been tested for stis and confirmed that you're both clean, the risk would significantly decrease. however, even then, birth control methods other than condoms do not protect you against stis. it's essential to regularly get tested if you're sexually active, and to try to find a way of protection that doesn't cause you discomfort such as a different brand or type of condom or a different method of contraception altogether."
N135,response_12,"yes, the risk of getting stis does increase with each instance of unprotected sex, regardless of whether you've already had unprotected sex once. sexually transmitted infections (stis) are passed from person to person through body fluids, and using a condom helps prevent this transmission. the act of having unprotected sex once does not make you immune to infection. instead, it's like playing russian roulette – each incident of unprotected sex presents a fresh risk of infection.

if you're experiencing pain or discomfort when using condoms, it could be due to allergies (especially if latex condoms are being used), lack of lubrication, or an improper fit. there are different sizes and types of condoms (like latex-free options) available that might provide a more comfortable experience. also, make sure to use ample lubricant, which can also significantly increase comfort.

in regards to sti's, it would be a good idea to get tested so that you know your current status. discussing this concern with your partner and ensuring you both get tested could help you understand the risks involved better.

and of course, don't forget about birth control options if pregnancy is not desired. there are many different types of birth control methods apart from condoms. consult a healthcare provider to find one that suits you best."
N135,response_13,"the risk of contracting an sti always exists when having unprotected sex, especially if you or your partner have other sexual partners, or if your partner's sti status is unknown. 

each time you have unprotected sex with a person, you're essentially rolling the dice. one instance of unprotected sex can potentially result in infection, but the more frequently unprotected sex occurs, the greater the probability of contracting an sti. so yes, you are at an increased risk the more you have unprotected sex, despite doing it once before with the same person.

it's really important to be aware of the potential consequences and to protect yourself accordingly. you could possibly explore other safer options like different brands/types of condoms, or other methods of protection that won't be as uncomfortable for you. wearing a condom can greatly reduce your risk.

lastly, both you and your partner(s) should consider getting tested regularly for stis if you're sexually active with multiple partners. open and honest communication about sexual health is vital in any relationship."
N135,response_14,"yes, if you continue to have unprotected sex with a person who may have a sexually transmitted infection (sti), your risk of contracting the infection increases with each exposure. even if the condom broke once, there might be a chance you didn't get infected the first time. however, going unprotected will significantly increase your likelihood of contracting an sti. it's always recommended to get tested if you suspect you might have exposed yourself to an sti, and have your partner do the same. repeated unprotected sex increases the chances of transmitting infections.

take note that there are alternative types of protection available for those who are allergic or sensitive to latex condoms. consider polyurethane condoms, female condoms, or investigate other alternatives with a healthcare professional. these options are not 100% foolproof, but can considerably lessen your risk compared to having unprotected sex."
N135,response_15,"yes, the probability of contracting stis increases with each unprotected sexual encounter. even if you have had unprotected sex once and did not contract an sti, that does not mean that you can't contract one in future encounters. each time you have sex without a barrier method (like a condom), you're essentially resetting the risk and exposing yourself to the potential of contracting an infection, assuming the other person is infected.

also, there's the risk of pregnancy if you're not using another form of contraception. if condoms hurt you, you can also consider different birth control options as well as having your partner get tested for stis before forego condoms. it's always best to speak with a healthcare provider about these concerns to get professional advice about your specific situation."
N135,response_16,"yes, every instance of unprotected sex with an individual who has an sexually transmitted infection (sti) increases the potential of contracting it. sometimes, stis might not exhibit symptoms, hence it's necessary to get tested regularly. the risk is incurred each time you have unprotected sex, not just the first time. 

however, if both partners get tested and are clean, and they are monogamous, risk decreases substantially. some stis (like hpv and herpes) can also be spread from skin-to-skin contact, not just sexual intercourse, so using condoms won't eliminate the risk completely but it does decrease it. consider discussing with your doctor about your reaction to condoms, there may be alternatives (like polyurethane condoms or female condoms) that will not cause discomfort. 

also, consider discussing with a healthcare provider about different forms of contraception to prevent pregnancy if that is a concern. remember, open and honest communication with your partner about sexual health is key."
N135,response_17,"yes, your risk of an sti will increase with unprotected sex. exposure to sexually transmitted infections (stis) happens every time you have unprotected sex with someone who has an sti, not just the first time. the initial exposure does not somehow ""protect"" you from subsequent exposures. each act of unprotected sex is an exposure risk. it is also essential to bear in mind that the risk of unwanted pregnancy increases dramatically without the use of condoms or other birth control methods.

if you have already had unprotected sex and are worried about stis, it may be a good idea to get tested. this can help reassure you and help you make decisions about what protection to use in the future. you might also want to have a discussion with your gynecologist regarding other condom alternatives, which can provide protection without causing you discomfort. please ensure that both you and your partner get regularly tested if you continue to engage in sexual activity."
N135,response_18,"the risk of sexually transmitted infections (stis) and pregnancy certainly increases with unprotected sex. one exposure does not automatically mean that if an sti were present, it would have been transmitted. however, every additional act of unprotected sex with someone who might be infected increases chances of transmission.

stis are not transmitted every time someone has sex with an infected person, but the risk accumulates with each exposure. similarly, pregnancy might not occur from a single episode of unprotected sex, but the chance of conception rises with each instance.

regardless, it's essential for both you and your partner to get tested. if one or both of you test positive for any stis, get treatment as soon as possible. consider discussing other forms of contraception that may be less uncomfortable for you, such as a female condom, an intrauterine device (iud), or hormonal contraceptives. 

remember to always protect yourself. it's better to prevent than regret. it's also important to have these discussions with your partner, so both of you understand and agree on the risks and forms of protection you will use. 

if condoms are causing discomfort, it may be due to an allergy to latex, the condom size, lack of lubrication, or another reason. therefore, it may be worth talking to a healthcare provider about these issues, too."
N135,response_19,"yes, the risk of contracting a sexually transmitted infection (sti) does increase if you have unprotected sex, regardless of whether it's once or multiple times. one instance of unprotected sex does not ensure immunity against contracting stis. every time you have unprotected sex, you're exposing yourself to potential stis. there is no 'safe' amount. it's critical that you both get tested and discuss your risks to mitigate the likelihood of contracting or transmitting an sti. also, consider discussing alternative birth control options with your doctor if condoms cause discomfort. you should always prioritize your sexual health."
N135,response_20,"yes, the risk of stis does increase with unprotected sex. each act of unprotected sex is a separate risk and increases the overall probability of contracting an sti. 

the risk doesn't compound based on past acts; every time you have unprotected sex, it's like rolling the dice again. you might have been lucky and not contracted an sti the first time, but that does not mean you're safe moving forward. 

one sexual encounter does not provide immunity to future encounters. if either partner has an sti or is at risk (e.g. not been tested, has had other sexual partners), every instance of unprotected sex presents a potential for transmission. 

therefore, it is recommended to use protection and/or get regular sti screenings. consider discussing other forms of protection with your healthcare provider if condoms are causing you discomfort. they may recommend alternatives like female condoms or dental dams, or methods to protect you from pregnancy, like contraceptives or iuds. however, remember that only barriers like condoms can also protect against stis."
N135,response_21,"having unprotected sex can increase the risk of sexually transmitted infections (stis) every time it occurs, not just the first time. each instance of unprotected sex with a person who has an sti can potentially expose you to the infection. stis are caused by bacteria, viruses, or parasites that are passed from one person to another during sexual contact. 

this means that one instance of unprotected sex doesn't guarantee you've contracted an sti, nor does it protect you from stis in future sexual encounters. you're putting yourself at risk every single time you have unprotected sex.

if bodily discomfort is the main reason why you're inclined to not use condoms, consult a healthcare professional to discuss alternatives or understand ways to alleviate the discomfort. they can guide you towards suitable alternatives like different sizes, materials, or types of contraception. 

you should also consider getting tested for stis, and asking your partner to do the same, to ensure you both are fully aware of your sexual health status. if either of you have an sti, you should seek treatment immediately. only resume sexual activity once your healthcare provider has indicated it's safe to do so."
N135,response_22,"yes, the risk of stis does increase with unprotected sex. many stis can be transmitted with just one sexual encounter, so even if the condom broke one time, you could still be at risk. if you continue having unprotected sex with this person, the risk increases with each encounter.

it's important to remember that stis can be asymptomatic, meaning they show no noticeable symptoms. therefore, regular testing is crucial.

you should definitely consult with a healthcare provider who can help you find safer methods that do not cause you pain (non-latex condoms, female condoms, etc.). or discuss use of pre-exposure prophylaxis (prep) if your partner has an sti to significantly reduce your risk of infection (depending on the sti).

furthermore, if there's a chance of unwanted pregnancy, consider discussing with a healthcare professional about emergency contraception, which can be used to prevent pregnancy after unprotected sex."
N135,response_23,"yes, the probability for sexually transmitted infections (stis) does increase with unprotected sex. if your partner has an sti, each exposure (each time you have sex) is a new opportunity for you to get infected. if you have sex often, and especially if your partner has multiple partners, each encounter is a risky one.

even if you've had sex once without protection, it's not a good reason to continue doing so, especially if you're not certain about the sti status of your partner. the risk doesn't necessarily decrease because you've already been exposed once.

if you're experiencing discomfort using condoms, it could be due to an allergy to latex or to the lubricants some condoms use. you might want to try a different brand or look for non-latex options that may be more comfortable.

as always, getting tested for stis regularly and knowing your partner's sti status is crucial in maintaining sexual health."
N135,response_24,"yes, each instance of unprotected sex carries its own set of risks, regardless of any previous encounters. having unprotected sex just once does not necessarily mean that you're instantly infected with stds, nor does it mean that you're immune to them if you continue to have unprotected sex. 

contracting stds depends on many various factors: whether or not your partner is infected, the specific sexual activities you engage in, etc. unprotected sex always carries a higher risk of std transmission than protected sex.

to ensure your sexual health, consider additional forms of contraceptives to condoms that may not cause you discomfort, like birth control pills or iuds. note, however, these do not protect against stis. you should also get regular sti testing, especially after instances where a condom breaks during sexual intercourse. lastly, have open and candid conversations about sexual health with your partner(s). they should be willing to get tested as well and should share the results with you."
N135,response_25,"each sexual encounter carries its unique risk for transmission of stis, so frequency does indeed increase the likelihood of exposure. however, it's not a compounded risk. the risk doesn't increase because unprotected sex has occurred once before. rather, each independent occurrence of unprotected sex carries potential risk. 

regardless of that, unprotected sex does generally increase the risk of sti transmission when compared to protected sex. it is highly suggested that both partners get checked for stis after a condom break, and before having unprotected sex again.

if condoms are causing discomfort, it may be worth exploring other options. there could be an allergy to latex, or a problem with size or lubrication. there are non-latex condoms available, as well as different sizes and lubricated options. 

there are also other forms of protection, like dental dams for oral sex, and female or internal condoms. always consult with a healthcare provider for the best advice in this area."
