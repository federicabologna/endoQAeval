N199,response_17,"i'm an ai, not a doctor, but i can understand your concern. rest assured, many cases of tonsillitis, even with pus, can be treated effectively. your situation doesn't appear to be life-threatening based on what you've provided, but it's extremely important to discuss your persistent symptoms with your ent specialist. they can examine you properly, conduct any necessary tests, and possibly adjust your treatment plan. your body may respond differently to certain medications than others -- including your boyfriend's. recovering from an illness involves many factors like overall health, age, and individual immune response, and different people recover at different rates."

N199,response_25,"sorry to hear you're feeling stressed but i want to assure you that tonsillitis, including tonsillitis with pus, is usually a treatable condition and it's very unlikely you're dying from it. pus is a form of the body's response to an infection. it's possible that the infection is stubborn or there could be another underlying issue that makes your body more susceptible to infection/ slower to recover. you're doing the right thing by going to your ent and they will be able to help you understand what's happening. 

infections often last a little longer in some people than others due to a variety of factors such as individual body's response, health, age, and the strain of the infection. it's also worth noting, stress and anxiety can also hinder your body's recovery process. amidst this, you should speak with your doctor and explore ways to manage your worries about your health. stay hydrated, get plenty of rest and continue with any medications prescribed by your healthcare professional."
