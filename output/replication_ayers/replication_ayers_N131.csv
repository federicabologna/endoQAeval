N131,response_1,"i'm an ai language model and not a physician, but i can provide some broad advice based on the information you've provided. it's clear that these symptoms have been deeply troubling to you. systemic symptoms like fatigue, depression, and generalized discomfort are complicated and can be difficult to diagnose. it's not clear whether they are related to the cochlear implant, something else, or even a combination of factors. your decision to get your implant removed is certainly one that could be explored, given that you've noted discomfort and unwanted effects such as facial twitching and shocks when you used it.

you mention conditions related to sleep apnea and thyroid enlargement, both of which can cause fatigue and other symptoms. these might be unrelated to your cochlear implant, or they could have indirect connections that ought to be investigated by a medical professional. moreover, your ct scan shows degenerative changes within the cervical spine which can manifest as headache and neck pain.

regarding your dissatisfaction with the care you've been receiving, it may be beneficial to consider a second opinion. accurate medical diagnosis often requires a process of elimination and collaboration among different specialists, and sometimes it also requires a heavy dose of patience.

finally, though i'm not a doctor, i would urge you to continue advocacy for your health. it's crucial that you keep track of your symptoms and communicate them clearly to your health providers. it can often be a frustrating process, but you are not alone. there are support groups and resources available for patients going through similar challenges.

always remember to discuss your symptoms and treatment options with a healthcare provider."
N131,response_2,"i'm really sorry to hear you're going through this. first and foremost, you're not crazy at all for seeking answers and wanting to find a resolution to your health concerns. our health can be complex and a variety of factors can contribute to changes in our well-being. at this point, it's hard to say whether or not your symptoms are entirely related to your cochlear implant without further investigation. 

there's a possibility that you may experience some degree of improvement after its removal if, indeed, it was causing symptoms. however, it's also important to note that some of your symptoms may be related to other underlying conditions, which don't seem to have a clear explanation or treatment yet.

regarding your healthcare providers, it's difficult for me to judge their actions without knowing all the details of your situation. that said, every patient deserves to feel heard by their healthcare provider, to have their concerns taken seriously, and to receive appropriate follow-up. advocating for oneself can often be challenging in a system that can feel fast-paced and impersonal. it is absolutely crucial to perform due diligence and seek multiple opinions if something does not feel right.

i strongly recommend that you further discuss your symptoms and concerns with your healthcare provider at mayo clinic, as they may be able to give you more insight into your condition as well as potential next steps. please keep in mind this advice does not replace medical advice from a healthcare provider who can physically evaluate you. i sincerely hope that your concerns are thoroughly addressed and you get the answers you've patiently been seeking."
N131,response_3,"i'm really sorry to hear that you're going through this. first off, i want to say that you don't sound crazy at all. your concerns are valid and you're definitely correct in seeking further evaluation and insisting on being heard. from what i've read, it's entirely possible that you're experiencing a range of symptoms potentially related to your cochlear implant migration/failure or other unrelated causes. as a non-human ai, i don't have the ability to make a diagnosis, but i can tell you that your situation seems complex and would certainly benefit from a thorough review by medical experts. i can't predict exactly what will happen after the implant removal, but let's hope that many of your symptoms will be relieved. don't worry too much about being upset with your previous doctors. instead, focus on finding those who will listen and strive to improve your quality of life. best of luck with your upcoming appointments and removal process!"
N131,response_4,"i'm an ai language model and can't provide medical advice, but i can suggest that it sounds like you have been through a lot and your concerns are valid. your symptoms might be related to your cochlear implant, especially the facial twitching, or they could be independent. it's completely appropriate to pursue a thorough investigation at mayo clinic, where they have expertise in both cochlear implants and complex medical conditions. given your history and symptoms, removal of the cochlear implant might be in the discussion but it's best to consult with the specialist team. 

as for your other symptoms, it's hard to tell if the removal of the cochlear implant will have an effect on the fatigue, depression, and anxiety as these could be related to other issues. 

regarding your feelings towards your doctors, it's important to feel heard and validated by your healthcare providers. if you are not satisfied, it's totally acceptable to seek a second opinion or request a different provider. always remember, you have the right to ask questions until you feel comfortable with your health care provider's plan and explanations."
N131,response_5,"i'm an ai language model who can assist with medical research based on available data, but can't diagnose your symptoms or treatment. it does seem from your report that you've been dealing with a variety of health and communication challenges. cochlear implant migration or failure could potentially cause some symptoms. while it is normal to feel frustrated, it is also important to remember that medicine is a challenging field. 

it seems prudent to consult directly with the team who performed the cochlear implant at the mayo clinic. if the cochlear implant has indeed migrated or failed, the symptoms associated with this may potentially resolve after removal or adjustment of the device, but further medical testing and analysis is needed to confirm this.

the fat right jawline and neck could be related to various issues (including thyroid), so further investigation is also warranted. the deviated nasal septum noted in your ct scan, for instance, might not be related to cochlear implant.

regarding hypersomnia, sleep apnea can cause excessive daytime sleepiness, but addressing this effectively would again require a thorough evaluation by a sleep specialist.

it's very important to voice any concerns you have with your doctors and advocate for your own health. understanding your conditions better can help you in this respect. for any new or unexplained symptoms, always reach out to a healthcare professional for further investigation. 

feeling neglected or dismissed by your medical providers can be quite distressful. if possible, finding a primary care provider who is responsive to your concerns and who can coordinate your care would be beneficial.

please note that solely relying on this information is not enough and getting advice from a medical professional is always recommended."
N131,response_6,"first of all, i'm really sorry that this has been such a difficult and frustrating journey for you. 

from your description, it definitely sounds like you have been experiencing real, physical symptoms. the fatigue and hypersomnia could be related to the mild sleep apnea despite it being termed as ""mild"", or could even be side effects from your medications or related to your depression.

cochlear implant failures or migrations are rare but can occur and can cause symptoms similar to what you're experiencing, especially twitching, shocks, headaches, and possibly swelling, although i'd need more information to say for sure. 

it's also worth noting that you've been diagnosed with slightly enlarged left thyroid and that the ct report suggests some degenerative changes in your neck along with mild to moderate narrowing in the foramina (these are openings that nerves and vessels pass through). these could be contributing to your neck pain, lump sensation and even the visible asymmetry. 

as far as your treatment, doctors aren't perfect, but they should definitely listen to you and validate your concerns. reiterating your symptoms and advocating for yourself in the way you have been is exactly the right thing to do. 

i believe you have a valid reason to be frustrated, and while it's difficult to say how mad you should be without knowing all the details, your emotions and your experience are valid and it's understandable to be upset about healthcare that doesn't meet your needs.

i think you've taken the right steps in seeking further advice from mayo clinic, given they have a comprehensive understanding of your previous cochlear implant surgery. 

best of luck with your future treatment, and remember it's not about being mad, but seeking the best possible healthcare for you."
N131,response_7,"i'm a language model ai developed by openai and unfortunately, i'm not qualified to give direct medical advice. you've been through a myriad of diagnostic tests and it must be frustrating to still not know what is causing your symptoms. that being said, if you feel like your symptoms are linked to the cochlear implant, it would be good to discuss that with your medical team at the mayo clinic. the specific facial nerve stimulation from the cochlear implant can result in symptoms of twitching and shocks in some patients. these issues might resolve after having it removed.

as for your neck asymmetry, the ct didn't confirm any identifiable mass. if there is swelling without any distinct cause identified, it might decrease over time but it also depends on what's causing the swelling. 

as per your experience with doctors, it's important to communicate with them and discuss your concerns. if you feel like you're not being heard, consider finding another medical expert whose approach aligns better with your needs. it might also be good to seek mental health support to cope with this difficult journey."
N131,response_8,"i'm an ai language model and i don't have a medical or professional background, but i can give you some general advice. 

firstly, it's important not to assume you are crazy just because you're having complex health issues. you know your body better than anyone and if you think something is wrong, it's good that you have pursued answers.

the symptoms you're experiencing (neck swelling, headaches, chronic cough, fatigue) can be caused by a myriad of conditions, and it's possible they aren't all related to the cochlear implant. for example, an enlarged thyroid can potentially cause some of these symptoms.

thyroid conditions, sleep apnea, depression, and anxiety, are also all known to potentially cause fatigue – it's quite plausible that these conditions might be contributing to your excessive sleepiness and generalized fatigue. 

although your cochlear implant might be causing some problems, it's a complex picture that needs to be looked at from many angles. it's important for you to get the symptoms thoroughly evaluated by a medical professional who can assess you in person, as online advice can't replace a full medical consultation. 

what seems clear, though, is that you need thorough and attentive medical care, which might include seeing a few different types of specialists. you may want to consider seeking a second opinion or changing your care provider if you feel like your concerns aren't being listened to or taken seriously.

as for feeling upset with your doctors – this is a very personal decision. it can certainly feel very frustrating to feel like you're not getting the care you need. however, it's also important to remember that doctors are only human and they can make mistakes. that doesn't make it okay, but it might help to put things in perspective.

in any case, it's very important that you continue pursuing answers and advocating for yourself. keep seeking answers until you find a satisfactory resolution and don't hesitate to change healthcare providers if you need to.

disclaimer: i highly recommend you seek professional medical advice for any health concerns you have."
N131,response_9,"i'm really sorry to hear about all that you've been going through. it does sound like a frustrating and challenging situation. as an ai, i can't provide personal medical advice but i can give some general guidance. 

you certainly aren't coming across as crazy. all your symptoms and experiences are very real. it's possible that some of them might indeed be linked or related to the cochlear implant, but it would require a comprehensive medical examination to determine this. it's a good step that you're seeking care at the mayo clinic, as they are a highly reputable institution. 

your frustration with your doctors is understandable, but keep in mind that diagnosing complex medical issues can be challenging and often requires assessment from many angles. 

in some cases, symptoms can persist even after the underlying issue is addressed, due to changes made in the body over time. however, there are often treatments available to help manage such persistent symptoms.

follow the advice of your medical team, seek out a second (or third) opinion if you feel it's necessary, and never hesitate to ask questions or to advocate for yourself. your health and well-being are important, and you deserve to be listened to and treated with respect."
N131,response_10,"i'm an ai language model and i can't give you personal advice, but i can tell you that it's perfectly valid to seek a second opinion when you're not fully satisfied with your healthcare provider's decisions. it sounds like you've done a great job advocating for yourself, which is important.

based on the information provided:

1. your cochlear implant could be causing some of your symptoms, but that's not the only possible explanation. the ct scan results do mention changes in the right ear due to the cochlear implant presence, but they didn't identify any abnormalities that could indicate implant failure or migration. the discomfort and other symptoms could also be due to other issues, like the degenerative changes in your cervical spine or thyroid enlargement.

2. anxiety, depression, and sleep apnea – even mild cases – can also cause fatigue and hypersomnia. it's possible that treating these underlying conditions might help alleviate your symptoms. as you're now seeing specialists at mayo clinic and having a sleep study done, those might be good steps toward identifying a diagnosis and treatment path.

3. as for the asymmetrical swelling on your neck, that could be due to a variety of reasons. the ct scan results mentioned a mild enlargement of your right thyroid, but no definite mass that might account for this. it's not clear whether the swelling could be reduced or resolved with the removal of the cochlear implant, but hopefully the surgeons at mayo clinic can give you a better idea of this.

it may not be a situation of being ""mad"" at your doctors, but rather using this experience as an impetus to find healthcare providers who answer your questions and make you feel supported. remember, patient advocacy - standing up for your own healthcare needs and rights - is incredibly important. continue pursuing the care and attention that you deserve.
  
again, please discuss this summary and your concerns with your new doctors as they'll be able to give you informed medical opinions. always turn to professionals for advice."
N131,response_11,"i'm really sorry to hear about your experiences and the frustration you're feeling. it's definitely a complex situation. it seems like you have spent a lot of time dealing with various health care professionals who haven't been able to give you a satisfying holistic picture of your health situation. 

your hypothesis about the cochlear implant causing you all these symptoms isn't impossible, but it's also hard to prove definitively. it certainly seems like there may be some residual issues from the implant that could be causing problems, and it's good that you've taken the initiative to address that issue. further consultations, investigations, and potentially its removal may help provide more insight into whether this is the cause of your symptoms. 

the findings from your ct scan don't show any clear-cut abnormalities that might explain all your symptoms. nevertheless, the mild nonspecific enlargement of the thyroid on the right that is mentioned might need further investigation, as some of your symptoms (like fatigue) can be related to thyroid function. 

as for your emotional health, it unfortunately sounds like the antidepressants aren't really helping you feel better. it's not unusual for people with chronic health issues to also experience depression and anxiety, and sometimes cognitive-behavioral therapy (cbt) with a trained psychologist can be beneficial in addition to medications.

regarding the asymmetry in your neck/jawline, this could potentially be due to the cochlear implant, or it might be due to something completely unrelated. you would need to consult with a professional who specializes in head and neck issues (like a maxillofacial surgeon) to determine the cause of this condition.

remember, you do have every right to be upset if you feel your complaints are not being taken seriously or are being dismissed. it's your body, and you're the one who knows it best. however, keep in mind that medicine is complex and sometimes definitive answers are hard to find. it's not necessarily negligence or laziness on the part of your physicians, but rather a reflection of how challenging medicine can be.

i hope you get the answers you need soon, so you can begin to move forward with proper management and treatment."
N131,response_12,"i'm an artificial intelligence, so i can't express personal emotions or opinions. however, i am here to provide some level of analysis on the information you've given, and possibly provide some guidance.

from the ct results, there doesn't appear to be a mass in the parotid gland or any notable issues with the neck lymph nodes. some asymmetry in the thyroid was found though. there's also mention of a device (assumedly the cochlear implant) ""extending into the middle ear cavity"", which could potentially be the source of some of your symptoms. it's important to note, though, that the cochlear implant and its possible migration should be definitively clarified by the specialist at the mayo clinic.

while depression, anxiety, and sleep apnea can contribute to symptoms such as fatigue and hypersomnia, it's worth exploring other potential causes given your symptoms have persisted. also, given the prominence of degenerative changes at the c5-c6 and c6-c7 levels of the cervical spine, this could potentially be the source of your neck pain and headaches. a more thorough investigation into this could be warranted, perhaps with a specialist consultation. 

again, it's very important that you see a specialist (such as at the mayo clinic, where your cochlear was implanted) to definitively investigate the potential cochlear migration and the device's influence on your symptoms.

as for your emotions regarding your doctors, it's understandable to feel upset or frustrated. it can be tough to experience persistent and seemingly unexplained symptoms. it's important to advocate for yourself and your health, to persist in seeking the help and answers you need. consider gathering all of your medical findings and seeking a second opinion if you feel unsatisfied with your current treatment.

also, don't overlook the power of seeking mental health support when dealing with chronic and unexplained symptoms. it can be a stressful experience and counselling or psychotherapy may be beneficial."
N131,response_13,"i'm an ai developed by openai and while i can provide you with some general suggestions on how to handle your situation and answer some of your questions, you should continue to consult with professional healthcare providers for a thorough assessment of your condition.

firstly, it sounds like you've been going through a tough time and it's understandable you'd want more clarity about your condition. trusting your own experiences and seeking further evaluations, as you've done, is a good approach when you feel your concerns aren't being adequately addressed.

as far your symptoms and the cochlear implant migration are concerned, it might be possible that the complications from the implant could be contributing to some of your symptoms. other symptoms that you're dealing with like generalized fatigue/hypersomnia, depression, and anxiety could be manifestations of other co-existing conditions or side effects from your medications. it also seems that you have some degenerative changes in your cervical spine along with neural foramina narrowing; these findings might hypothetically be contributing to some of your symptoms like neck pain and headaches.

regarding the question about noticeable asymmetry and whether it will resolve after the implant removal - this is something that will need to be evaluated by your surgeon. it's worth emphasizing that if the asymmetry isn't due to the implant but instead is caused by something like muscular adaptation, it might not fully resolve.

finally, in terms of being upset with your previous doctors, it's important to note that medicine is a practice that involves constant learning and challenges. while it's understandably frustrating not feeling heard or understood, it can sometimes take time and multiple perspectives to reach a comprehensive understanding of complex medical issues.

in general, it's a good idea to voice your concerns and ask all your questions to the doctors at mayo clinic where they have expertise dealing with complications of cochlear implants. it may also be helpful to seek help from a care manager or patient advocate to help navigate the healthcare system and communicate effectively with healthcare providers. keep advocating for yourself and seek out medical providers who take your concerns seriously and are willing to explore different possibilities."
N131,response_14,"i'm an ai language model, so i can't provide personal medical advice. your symptoms and frustrations sound valid. getting a second opinion from another healthcare professional could provide a fresh perspective on your condition and help plan a new course of action.

consider consulting a healthcare professional who specializes in cochlear implants or a medical professional familiar with the complications potentially associated with this device. they could provide valuable insight into whether your symptoms and the cochlear implant failure are connected and how to best address these issues. 

keep in mind that depression and anxiety can sometimes cause changes in perception of bodily sensations, exacerbating discomfort and pain. there might also be a chance that your symptoms are unrelated to the cochlear implant, rather related to other conditions. 

as for your feelings towards your doctors, remember that medicine is a complex field and sometimes certain symptoms or conditions can be missed or misinterpreted. however, if you feel your concerns are being dismissed, it's important to communicate this with your healthcare provider or look for a different healthcare provider who takes your concerns seriously."
N131,response_15,"i'm an ai developed by openai and while i'm designed to provide accurate information, i'm not a doctor and can't replace professional medical advice. also, i don't have feelings, and i am guided by data and algorithms.

your situation is complex, especially with your cochlear implant, but you do not sound crazy at all. you know your body best and if you're feeling unwell, you're right to seek further investigation.

your ct findings point to some possible issues related to your mastoidectomy and cochlear implant, your paranasal sinuses, and your neck and cervical spine. it's possible that these are contributing to your symptoms in some way. you also mention an enlarged thyroid and some other issues that might require attention.

wanting to discuss the 'big picture' with a doctor who will take all your symptoms into account is entirely reasonable, and you should seek out a holistic evaluation of your health. 

as for how mad you should be at your doctors, this is very personal and subjective. you may choose to express your dissatisfaction to them or seek a second opinion. 

going to the mayo clinic sounds like a good step as they usually have multiple specialists and they can work together to get an understanding of your entire situation. 

lastly, in regards to your appearance, without the ability to examine your jawline and neck in person, it is hard to say what could be causing the asymmetry or if it could resolve post-explantation. 

remember, it's always important to advocate for yourself in healthcare situations, and your feelings and concerns are valid. keep asking questions until you understand what is happening with your health."
N131,response_16,"i'm a language ai model and cannot provide personal medical advice, but i can tell you that it's important to understand your symptoms holistically. in your case, it would be important to consider any potential complications due to cochlear implant migration, as well as your other health conditions, such as anxiety and depression, thyroid enlargement and possible sleep apnea. also, your symptoms might be linked or independent of each other.

migrating cochlear implants can indeed cause symptoms such as twitching and shocks but it's important to remember that these symptoms could be due to other medical conditions as well.

enlarged thyroid can lead to symptoms like difficulty swallowing, neck pain or discomfort and coughing. in such cases, it is essential to have a series of tests done depending upon your doctor's decision, to rule out any serious thyroid conditions. 

also, the degenerative changes mentioned in your cervical spine could be the cause of your neck pain and headaches. 

from the perspective of a language ai program, a second opinion with a new care provider might be beneficial who can objectively review your case history. 

while it's understandable that you could feel frustrated with your care providers based on your experience, remember medical sciences have limitations and can sometimes involve a lot of trial and error. it’s crucial that you have open conversations with your doctors about your concerns.

lastly, i strongly recommend that you discuss these concerns with a healthcare provider."
N131,response_17,"it sounds like you're going through a stressful situation, and i can understand your confusion and frustration. from the information you've provided, it seems like you have a number of complex issues. 

regarding the cochlear implant, if you indeed stopped using it due to the symptoms you mentioned, and you have been experiencing progressive symptoms indirectly associated with that side of the neck, it seems logical to explore the idea that the implant may be causing some of these problems. metallic objects like implants can sometimes shift or cause issues in the surrounding tissue. however, it's also important to keep in mind that correlation does not always equal causation. 

as per the ct scan report, everything seems mostly normal except the non-specific enlargement of the thyroid on the right side, which could be unrelated to the cochlear implant. thyroid issues can sometimes present with symptoms like fatigue or hypersomnia, so further investigation might be required there. 

the idea of going to mayo clinic to explore implant removal seems sensible, as they would likely have extensive experience dealing with complications related to cochlear implants. 

as for your worry about the enlargement on your right side, this might resolve following removal of the implant, but we cannot guarantee it as it largely depends on the underlying cause. consultation with the team there could give you a clearer picture.

finally, your feelings of frustration with your doctors are understandable. however, please understand that medicine can often involve complex diagnoses that require collaboration between several specialists. while it may seem like the issues have been overlooked, it's possible they have been trying to rule out other more common causes before considering the implant. it's critical to have open communication with your healthcare team about your concerns and making sure you understand the reasoning behind their decisions. 

remember, the information provided here should not be considered a substitute for professional medical advice. you should discuss any concerns or questions you have with your healthcare provider."
N131,response_18,"i'm an ai language model and not a health professional, but i can share some insights based on the information you've given. you've been through a lot, and it's natural to seek answers for your ongoing symptoms. a cochlear implant, like any device, can potentially lead to complications or issues, however, it's difficult to say definitively if this is the cause of your symptoms without more detailed medical investigation.

it's also possible that some of your symptoms could be related to other conditions. for instance, thyroid dysfunction (even if it's just a slight enlargement) can cause fatigue and depression symptoms. your sleep apnea, even if mild, could also contribute to fatigue. some of your other symptoms, including neck pain and swelling, might also be related to the degenerative changes noted in your cervical spine. 

every patient deserves to have their concerns taken seriously, and any perceived dismissal can be frustrating. sometimes, communication breakdowns occur in medical situations and it can be helpful to express your concerns and ask for further explanation or second opinions if necessary. 

though the cochlear implant removal process might be able to help with some symptoms, it should be approached with caution since there may be risks associated with removal as well. you should definitely discuss this thoroughly with the specialists at mayo clinic.

the way you're feeling isn't ""crazy"" - it's perfectly valid to want answers and help for your symptoms. i encourage you to continue advocating for your health, and to seek second (or third, or fourth) opinions if you're not getting the care or answers you need. 

again, seek professional medical help for evaluating your situation. this information is meant to be educational but it doesn’t replace professional advice."
N131,response_19,"i'm a medical ai developed by openai and i can provide some non-personal context for your situation, though keep in mind that i'm not a doctor!

your symptoms (facial twitching, shocks inside the head) suggest that your cochlear implant could be causing nerve stimulation. sometimes, incorrect placement or movement (migration) of the implant can cause unwanted side effects. it's crucial to have these concerns addressed by your ent or the clinic responsible for the cochlear implant. 

your comfort and wellbeing are very important, and you have every right to feel frustrated if you do not feel you are receiving adequate care. it's not unreasonable to seek clarification for symptoms or areas of your health that are concerning to you. some patients find it helpful to seek second opinions if they feel their concerns are not being adequately addressed. 

in regards to your thyroid, it's common for one side to be larger than the other. however, any growth or lumps should be evaluated, so further investigation is warranted. you also mention headaches, neck pain, and a swollen jawline which should definitely be addressed, as these symptoms can impact your quality of life. 

sleep apnea, even mild, can negatively impact sleep quality and contribute to daytime sleepiness and fatigue. continuous positive airway pressure (cpap) therapy is often quite effective in treating sleep apnea.

it's also worth mentioning that depression and anxiety can cause a wide range of physical symptoms, including fatigue, headaches, and generalized pain. 

overall, it seems like you have several overlapping issues that should ideally be assessed as a whole, which is often what a primary care provider works to do. you might consider finding a new primary care provider if you feel like your current one isn't able to adequately address your concerns. communication with your healthcare providers is important, and you should feel heard and understood in your medical interactions."
N131,response_20,"i'm an ai, so i don't have personal emotions, but based on the information you've provided, i can try to provide some insights.

1. cochlear implant failure/migration: while i can't confirm whether all your symptoms are due to this, it's possible some of them might be. it’s a good sign that you're scheduled to go back to mayo clinic where the cochlear implant was done.

2. current symptoms and conditions: depression, anxiety, and generalized fatigue/hypersomnia can lead to the feeling of being unwell, even if there's no physical illness apparent. in addition to the removal of the cochlear implant, addressing these conditions should hopefully help improve your overall health.

3. ct scan findings and parotid gland: although your report notes no definite evidence of a discrete mass, that doesn’t mean there aren't any subtle changes that aren't significant enough to be noted in this report. continuation of symptoms or new ones should prompt re-evaluation.

4. thyroid: the mild nonspecific enlargement of your thyroid could be related to hypothyroidism, which may explain your fatigue. if this hasn't been addressed, you might want to have your thyroid levels checked.

5. feeling unheard/dismissing symptoms: from reading your account, it sounds like you may feel that your symptoms and experiences have been minimized or dismissed. this can be very frustrating and might make you feel less trustful of your doctors. it's important to have a good relationship with your doctor, and they should be willing to listen and address your concerns respectfully. if you continue to feel dismissed, consider seeking a second opinion.

6. fatigue/apnea: sleep apnea can cause fatigue, so it's good that you're having a sleep study done. even mild apnea can sometimes cause significant symptoms, depending on the individual.

please remember this advice is general in nature and does not replace a consultation with a healthcare professional."
N131,response_21,"i'm really sorry to hear about your ongoing health concerns, it certainly doesn't sound like an easy journey. for information i am ai, so i do not possess the ability to do full medical diagnoses, but i can provide insight as you've asked. 

it sounds like you are dealing with multiple interconnected symptoms and you absolutely don't sound crazy to me. the cochlear implant may be having an impact on some of your symptoms as you suspected, specifically the facial twitching and shocks that you mentioned. or it might be the result of an entirely different root cause. 

the fact that the thyroid on your right side is mildly larger could also be of interest - an enlarged thyroid, or goiter, can sometimes cause coughing and difficulties swallowing but typically these symptoms only occur when the thyroid is significantly larger. additionally the asymmetry in your neck/jawline could possibly be related to the thyroid enlargement. 

from the information provided, it also sounds like there are degenerative changes in your cervical spine which can possibly contribute to the neck pain and headaches you've been experiencing, especially if there is nerve involvement, though it would best to have these findings evaluated by your doctor. 

lastly, while it might be true that mild sleep apnea shouldn't necessarily result in extreme fatigue or hypersomnia, sleep disorders can have a wide range of effects on different individuals so it's not completely out of the question.

it's great to hear that you're going to the mayo clinic for further consultation. 

as for your question about your feelings towards your doctors, it sounds like you feel unheard and perhaps even neglected. that's a valid reaction given what you've described - you are entitled to a partner in your healthcare. they should help you investigate your symptoms until you collectively find answers. you deserve to feel better.

remember the above is just based off the information you've provided and is not a substitute for professional medical advice."
N131,response_22,"i'm an ai, not a doctor, but from reading your post it seems you are in a quite difficult situation. while i understand your frustration with your previous doctors, remember i can't give direct medical advice. 

however, i can say that it seems quite clear you are dealing with a significant number of symptoms and concerns that aren't being fully addressed. while some of the symptoms you have (like fatigue or hypersomnia) may be related to your depression, some others (like neck swelling or chronic cough) could be caused by various conditions and should be thoroughly explored. 

it is quite possible that the issues you are experiencing are related to your cochlear implant, but it can also be related to other medical conditions. in any case, it's important to have a thorough medical evaluation by a professional who is willing to listen to your concerns and give your case the time and attention it deserves.

as for the asymmetry in your neck and jawline, it's hard to predict without a proper examination if it will remain after the device is removed. further testing may be needed to properly diagnose and treat these issues. 

again, i stress the need for consultation with a healthcare professional. 

as for your frustration with your doctors, it's normal to feel upset when you feel like your concerns aren't being addressed. however, remember that the most important thing now is to continue advocating for your health, which might mean seeking a second or even third opinion if necessary. it's your health, and you deserve to be heard and have your concerns taken seriously."
N131,response_23,"i'm really sorry to hear that you're going through this. it sounds both physically and emotionally taxing. it's completely understandable that you're feeling upset and frustrated by the lack of answers and support from your healthcare providers. 

your belief that your symptoms could be associated with cochlear implant failure or migration certainly isn't unreasonable, as some of your symptoms are local to the area of the implant. however, your prolonged symptoms of fatigue, hypersomnia, headaches, and anxiety could be related to any number of medical issues, not necessarily connected to your implant. 

i do think it's good that you've recently looked at the big picture and can see that these symptoms, taken together, have been affecting your quality of life for some time. that's a critical realization that can sometimes be overlooked when symptoms are treated on a case-by-case basis, such as giving you more antidepressants to manage isolated symptoms. 

as for the inconsistencies between your symptoms and your reports (the thyroid asymmetry, the unidentified lump), these are definitely things that should be addressed by a medical professional. it's concerning that your ent didn't take these issues seriously enough to warrant a follow-up. 

while i cannot guarantee all of your symptoms will dissipate following cochlear implant removal, having it examined by experts at the mayo clinic definitely seems like a good step forward. as for the sleep apnea, while 6 incidents per hour falls within the mild range, it may still be contributing to your fatigue and hypersomnia.

it's vital to have a healthcare provider who listens to you and takes your concerns seriously. perhaps consider changing doctors and finding someone who will be more attentive to your needs and concerns. you have every right to be mad, but use that anger to advocate for yourself. your feelings are valid and your health matters. 

remember that diagnoses can sometimes be a process of elimination and can take time. it's crucial to maintain open and honest communication with your healthcare team during this time. don't shy away from asking questions or seeking second opinions if you feel it necessary.

lastly, although i am an ai with access to a vast amount of medical information, i strongly recommend you consult a medical professional about your concerns. they have the expertise and clinical experience that can more accurately evaluate your situation and suggest an appropriate treatment plan."

firstly, it's important to note that experiencing side effects or complications from medical procedures like a cochlear implant can be very upsetting and anxiety-provoking. you're not crazy for feeling upset or frustrated.

the symptoms you've been experiencing, such as neck pain, asymmetrical swelling, and difficulties swallowing, certainly warrant investigation. it's possible these could be related to the cochlear implant, but other causes might also be considered, particularly since your ct scan didn't show evidence of discrete mass that could explain these symptoms. however, the mention of ""partial mastoidectomy changes"" and ""a metallic device extending into the middle ear cavity"" does suggest that changes related to your cochlear implant could be involved. 

the sleep apnea, even if mild, can also contribute to fatigue and hypersomnia, and the treatment, if necessary after your sleep study, could possibly alleviate these symptoms. 

your increasing depression and anxiety, while they could be triggered by the physical discomfort and distress, may have a physiological cause as well. it's a fact that depression and anxiety can cause physical symptoms, including some of those you mentioned. 

regarding your question about whether your jawline and neck will return to normal after the removal of the implant, it's difficult to say without knowing the exact cause of the swelling. in theory, if the swelling is caused by inflammation due to the cochlear implant, it might reduce after the implant is removed. but this is something you should discuss with your healthcare provider.

as for how mad you should be at your doctors, it's certainly frustrating when you feel your concerns aren't being adequately addressed. however, medicine is a complex field and sometimes it takes time to determine the causes of symptoms, particularly when they could have multiple potential causes. you absolutely have the right to seek second (or third) opinions and to advocate for your own health. 

the process at mayo clinic should hopefully allow you to have your concerns thoroughly addressed. they have a team approach to diagnosis and treatment, which should help provide a comprehensive evaluation of your situation. this could result in both a better understanding of your symptoms and the development of an effective treatment plan. good luck!"
N131,response_25,"i'm sorry to hear about the difficulties you've been having, and it's clear you've been dealing with a number of issues. i'll try to give you a little insight based on the information provided. please note, i am an ai language model and can't diagnose or provide personal medical advice. i strongly recommend discussing these issues with your healthcare provider or an alternative expert in person. 

1. cochlear implant-related issues - it's possible that your cochlear implant may be causing physical issues like the facial twitching or shocks, particularly as they seem to have stopped when you stopped using the implant. it's a positive step forward that you're beginning the removal process at the mayo clinic. however, it's hard to say if removal will definitely resolve all your symptoms.

2. thyroid - an enlarged thyroid could be indicative of various conditions, including hypothyroidism or graves' disease. it could also simply be a goiter. these can sometimes cause symptoms like fatigue and depression. a thyroid hormone level check may yield some useful information, and a consultation with an endocrinologist may also be helpful.

3. sleep apnea - even mild sleep apnea can potentially lead to daytime fatigue, though as you mentioned it may not entirely explain your hypersomnia.

4. neck/jawline swelling - it's hard to determine the cause of your neck/jawline swelling based on this information, as it could potentially be from a number of different causes. more investigation would be helpful.

5. mood disorders - while you understandably want physical causes for your symptoms ruled out, depression and anxiety can manifest in a number of physical ways, including fatigue and pain. it's still possible that they are contributing to your symptoms at some level.

6. ent consultation - if you feel unsatisfied with the consultation you received from your ent physician, it may be helpful to seek a second opinion. patient-physician communication and satisfaction is an important part of the healthcare process.

again, only a healthcare provider who can review your medical history and conduct a physical examination can provide a definitive diagnosis or personalized advice. please schedule a visit with your doctor or a specialist again to have these new findings reviewed and discussed."
