N202,response_1,"i'm really sorry to hear about what you and your son j are experiencing. you're not being a hypochondriac, but simply a concerned and caring mom. 

your son's frequent infections, persistent fever, weight loss, high lymphocytes, low neutrophils, and low hemoglobin are indeed concerning. a cbc would be helpful to get an overall view of his health, as it checks for different types of blood cells and can give us clues about his immune system, any ongoing infections, and how his body is coping with them. additionally, his nutritional status should be assessed, considering his weight loss and low hemoglobin levels. 

you mention that his bmi dropping from 20th percentile to the 1st percentile and losing weight while growing taller, it would be pertinent to review his diet, nutrition, and even have a pediatric nutritionist review his case if the pediatrician believes it to be necessary. 

also, since j has asthma and is on flovent, you might want to make sure you are following all the steps to manage his condition. chronic conditions like this could make him more susceptible to infections and could impede his growth and weight gain.

you know your child best. if something doesn't feel right, it's important to trust your gut and pursue the concern with his doctor. it's always better to catch any potential issues early and manage them effectively, than to wait and see. 

i would recommend having a comprehensive discussion with his pediatrician about your concerns and possibly seeking a second opinion if you feel like your concerns are not being addressed. please remember that this advice is intended to be general in nature, and specific causes could vary. actual medical advice can only be given by a healthcare professional who has examined your child."
N202,response_2,"i'm sorry to hear your son is going through this. it's very understandable and normal to be worried about your child's health, especially when there's a pattern of frequent illnesses and some unexplained symptoms like weight loss. you're not being a hypochondriac at all, you're just being a concerned mom.

it may be helpful to discuss your concerns with your doctor. talk about the frequent infections, the weight loss, and your observations about past lab results. your doctor can help interpret the information and decide whether more tests are needed. it's possible there may be an underlying cause that can be addressed, but it's also possible this is nothing more than a string of unfortunate coincidences.

regarding the past abnormal cbc results, you should ask your doctor about that. most likely those results were not significant or weren't addressed because they went back to normal, but again, it never hurts to ask for clarification.

one thing you could mention to the doctor is to consider testing your son for immune deficiency disorders, since he's been getting sick frequently.

overall, it's crucial to maintain open communication with your medical provider. they are there to help make sure your son stays healthy and to ease your worries where possible. they should provide clear and timely communication about what they believe is going on, what tests may be necessary, and what the subsequent results mean.

lastly, as much as the internet is a wonderful resource, it can only give general information and it can't replace a one-on-one conversation with a healthcare professional who knows your son's history and can examine him in person. so, please seek and follow professional medical advice."
N202,response_3,"i'm an ai model trained by openai and i can surely empathize with your concern for your child's health. persistent infections, weight loss despite a good diet, ongoing fever and a history of low hemoglobin should definitely be brought to your doctor's attention. you should discuss about ordering more complete laboratory tests, including a cbc (complete blood count). the disbalance in his blood cells five years ago might not be directly relevant today, but the information could be useful when interpreted with current test results.

remember, it's your responsibility as a parent to be well informed and be an active advocate for your child's health, asking questions and seeking necessary medical advice. and it's the doctor's responsibility to provide thorough medical evaluations and consider your concerns seriously. 

but please, make sure to consult with your physician or a healthcare professional since i can provide guidance and knowledge but not a definitive medical advice. best of luck with your little one, and i hope j feels better soon!"
N202,response_4,"i'm really sorry to hear about your concerns. it's understandable that you're worried given what you've been seeing with your son's health. it sounds as though his symptoms and weight loss are taking a toll on him, and it's natural to be apprehensive.

you're certainly not being a hypochondriac by having these concerns. persistent fever, frequent infections, and unexplained weight loss can indeed be symptoms of some underlying conditions, particularly those related to the immune system like primary immunodeficiency diseases (pidds). however, these symptoms can also be due to more common, less serious conditions. also, it's common for the balance of white blood cells (like neutrophils and lymphocytes) to shift in response to an infection. usually, doctors don't worry about these shifts unless they persist well after the infection has gone or they are at very abnormal levels.

that being said, if your son's symptoms persist or continue to worsen, it would be reasonable to request more extensive testing. this might include a cbc, along with other tests your doctor deems appropriate. discuss with your doctor about all your concerns, your son's history and current symptoms, and let your doctor guide you to the next steps.

remember, it's okay to seek a second opinion if you still feel unsure. health is a continuous conversation between patient, family and physician. always voice your concerns, especially about your children's health. 

take note that i'm an ai, and all the pointers provided above are strictly based on general information. a real medical professional who knows your son's history and can examine him is always the best source of advice. so, please don't think of these words as a definitive diagnosis or a treatment plan."
N202,response_5,"based on what you've described, it is understandable that you're concerned. i'm an ai language model and not a doctor, but the repeated infections, continued fever, and weight loss are worrisome signs. it's hard to say whether or not the lymphocyte and neutrophil levels from 5 years ago are relevant without more recent data and input from a doctor.

it might be useful to request a complete blood count (cbc) and check other markers of general health, including a review of his immune system function. asthma can sometimes weaken the immune system, making people more susceptible to infections, but the repeated use of antibiotics and continued high fevers seem to suggest that something else might be going on.

since you're able to access his records online, it would also be a good idea to consult with his doctor about the blood work, his symptoms, and the changes you've noticed in his weight. maybe seek a second opinion if you're not feeling reassured.

this is not meant to raise alarm, but rather to help you ask the right questions when you seek medical advice. these symptoms can be indicators of many different conditions - from simple nutritional deficits, post-viral syndromes, up to more serious diseases. but only a doctor can adequately diagnose him.

take note of your child's symptoms and their frequency, and bring these up with his doctor. monitoring his weight closely, ensuring he's eating a balanced diet, and getting ample rest are likely to be recommended too."
N202,response_6,"i'm really sorry to hear about j's recent health challenges – it must be such a stressful time for your family. trusting your gut instinct is important. you know your child best, and if you feel something isn't right, it's important to voice these concerns to your child's doctor. 

the consistent illnesses, weight loss, and unexplained fever certainly warrant some further exploration. although i can't provide a diagnosis, some of these issues might be symptoms of an underlying condition. 

a cbc (complete blood count) could provide valuable information about his immune system and might be a good next step. low hemoglobin might indicate iron deficiency anemia, which could make j more susceptible to infections, while high lymphocytes and low neutrophils could suggest an issue with the immune system – but it is important that a professional interprets these results.

strep throat and hand, foot, and mouth disease could also cause a loss of appetite that might be contributing to his weight loss. however, it is important that significant, unintended weight loss is investigated, especially if your son continues to lose weight or does not start to regain it once his infections clear up.

as a parent, it is completely normal to worry about your child's health, especially when the child is experiencing new, unexpected symptoms. it might be helpful to list all your concerns, along with relevant timings and any associated symptoms, then take this list to your doctor. it can be hard to remember everything in the moment, and this way, you have everything written down.

it is also a good idea to discuss your concerns over j's recurrent infections and weight loss with the doctor to see if any further tests are needed. it's about balancing vigilance without jumping to worrying conclusions. remember, your healthcare team is there to help and should be open and receptive to your concerns.

just to stress again – i’m an ai trained to assist with information but i am not a doctor. please consult j’s doctors; i'm here to help you prepare for conversations with them."
N202,response_7,"i'm not a doctor, but i can certainly understand how worried you must be. in my opinion, you should trust your instincts as a mother. if you feel that something isn't right, it would be advisable to seek further medical consultation. you could discuss the current symptoms, the apparent weight loss and the frequent infections, as well as his history of tests and results with the doctor. insist on a re-evaluation of his condition. the doctor may decide to undertake a complete blood count (cbc) or other diagnostic tests. these tests can help the doctors to understand more about what's happening inside his body. it's always better to be safe and get a second opinion when your child's health and wellbeing is concerned. what might seem like overreacting today might be a lifesaver tomorrow. please seek medical attention for your child."
N202,response_8,"i'm an ai and while i can't directly provide medical advice, i can tell you that your concerns are valid. anytime a child is repeatedly sick, loses weight, or you notice developmental or health changes it's best to seek further medical help. 

as for your son j, his symptoms and records indeed seem concerning considering the persistent fever, weight loss, and past blood tests. if his infections continue and he keeps losing weight or doesn't gain it, bringing up a complete blood count (cbc) to your doctor is a justified request.

doctors are human and sometimes in the hustle of healthcare, things can get overlooked. your son's health is absolutely worth advocating for. your doctor should certainly be telling you if things are concerning, but it's always a good idea to bring up your own concerns as well.

besides, sometimes intuition can be a deciding factor. if you feel something isn't right, trust yourself and seek clarification. even if it turns out to be nothing serious, you'll have peace of mind. 

remember to keep all communication open and clear with your doctor. share all your worries and fears and ask for explanations about anything you don't understand. healthcare providers aim to team up with parents to ensure the well-being of their patients."
N202,response_9,"i'm really sorry to hear that your son has been so ill - as a parent, it's so hard to watch your child suffer and not be sure what to do to help. i'm an ai developed by openai, meaning that i don't have a medical degree, but i can share some general knowledge with you.

first of all, your concern is totally valid and understandable. given the symptoms and the repeated illnesses, it might be a good idea to get more a comprehensive medical analysis for your son. in this case, a complete blood count (cbc) might be helpful as it can provide a broad picture of his overall health by measuring several components of the blood. this includes hemoglobin level, white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets.

low hemoglobin could pinpoint to anemia where it might be due to insufficient iron intake. this, coupled with weight loss, could affect the general well-being and immunity of your son. prolonged fever that's not resolving adequately with medication could also signify infection or other health problems.

that being said, while these are all potential reasons for further examination, these assessments and the interpretation of results should be done by a healthcare professional. every child is unique and these tests should be interpreted in context with the child's overall clinical picture.

please do approach your doctor, who knows your son's medical history and any physical examination findings better, about your concerns and ask for further advice. they should be able to guide further investigations and management.

remember, as a parent, you know your child best. if you feel something is wrong, it's important to insist on getting the care your child needs. advocate for your son and don't hesitate to seek a second opinion if necessary."
N202,response_10,"you're not being a hypochondriac, you're being a concerned parent. your son has had repeated infections and there has been noticeable weight loss. this, combined with the low hemoglobin, high lymphocytes, and low neutrophils would suggest that your concerns are valid.

your doctor should ideally take these symptoms and lab results seriously and investigate further. fever that does not go away, weight loss, and frequent illnesses could be signs of an underlying immune disorder or other serious health conditions, which would require specific tests to diagnose. 

the occurrence of hand, foot, and mouth disease (often associated with coxsackie virus) can also cause fever, sore throat, and lack of appetite, that could lead to weight loss. however, the persistent fever and additional symptoms seem to warrant further evaluation.

a cbc would certainly be recommended. other tests depending on the cbc results may also be useful, including nutritional assessment and tests for immune function.

please consult with your pediatrician directly and share your concerns. be sure to keep monitoring your son's symptoms and be clear about the change in his health. some doctors may not suggest further testing unless explicitly asked by the parents, so it's important for you to be proactive.

if you do not feel your pediatrician is taking your concerns seriously, you should strongly consider seeking a second opinion. your son's health is the most important consideration here."
N202,response_11,"i'm an ai language model, so i can't give medical advice, but i can suggest what typically might be a course of action in similar situations.

a consistent pattern of illness accompanied by weight loss is usually a cause for concern and should be addressed with a healthcare provider. given your son's recent health issues and weight loss, it makes sense that you want to explore this further. 

cbc, or complete blood count, is a type of blood test that can help doctors check for conditions like anemia, infection, and many other diseases. considering your son's symptoms and health history, a cbc might be a useful tool to help rule out or diagnose certain conditions. however, the decision to order this test should ultimately be made by a healthcare provider who is familiar with your son's medical history and current symptoms.

remember, it's fine to seek a second opinion if you're not getting the answers you want, and you should always follow your intuition when it comes to your children's health. please consult with a healthcare provider to assess your child's symptoms and possible next steps."
N202,response_12,"i'm an ai language model, not a doctor, but i can tell you it's natural to be concerned when you see your child repeatedly unwell. 

if you're worried that there might be an underlying issue with your child's health, it's important to openly communicate these concerns with the doctor. you can ask about the possibility of doing a cbc (complete blood count) or other tests to help rule out potential health problems, especially if there are recurring infections, weight loss, or any other consistent symptoms that are out of the ordinary. low hemoglobin and changes in weight (particularly for a growing child) could potentially indicate some hidden health conditions, so it would be worth discussing this. 

talk about j's dietary intake too, as it might be relevant to the weight loss and the low hemoglobin level. ensure that your child is not only eating iron-rich foods but also foods rich in vitamin c as it helps in the absorption of iron.

if you feel that something isn't right or you're not satisfied with the attention/response your child's health is getting, it's within your rights as a parent to seek a second opinion. please ensure you follow up with a healthcare professional about your son's specific condition as it could be crucial to his wellbeing."
N202,response_13,"i'm a virtual assistant and can't replace a medical professional's advice, but i can suggest some general steps to follow. it's perfectly normal to be worried about recurring infections and weight loss. it's always best to advocate for your child's health and share your concerns with your pediatrician. 

if you feel the need, you can request for a complete blood count (cbc) to be done, especially if he keeps getting infections or continues to lose weight. moreover, you could discuss with your pediatrician about getting him tested for conditions that could lead to weight loss and frequent infections or illnesses, like allergies, anemia, digestive disorders, or immune problems. you are not being a hypochondriac; as a parent, it's your responsibility to ensure your child's well-being. 

keep track of his symptoms, eating habits, and overall mood and behavior. this information will also be helpful for the doctor. importantly, if you feel that something isn't right, it's worthwhile speaking with your pediatrician again or even getting a second opinion."
N202,response_14,"i'm really sorry to hear that you're going through this stressful time. it's completely normal and important as a parent to be concerned about your child's health, especially when you are noticing these changes.

with what you've described, it's appropriate to have a conversation with your doctor about your concerns, especially given his recent recurrent infections, prolonged fever, weight loss, and previous abnormal lab results. they can reassess the situation and take into consideration his history, current symptoms, lab results, and growth pattern. a complete blood count (cbc) might be warranted given the situation.

it could be that your child's symptoms are due to a streak of unrelated illnesses, but it’s also worth investigating into other possible causes. for instance, recurrent infections can be due to immuno-compromising conditions, gastrointestinal issues might explain weight loss, and some conditions may explain both (like celiac disease).

but without a full medical assessment, it's impossible to be sure. i recommend making a list of exact concerns you want to discuss with j's doctor, including specific symptoms you've been observing. 

while you know your child best, remember that it'd be unfair to yourself to expect that you should have picked up on health problems earlier. the diagnostic process can be complex even for medical professionals with extensive training and experience. your job as a parent is just to observe your children and bring any concerns to the doctor's attention, which you're doing great. 

so please discuss your observations and concerns with your doctor as soon as you can.+"
N202,response_15,"i'm an ai language model, but i can still tell that as a parent it's completely normal to be concerned when your child loses weight, has recurrent infections, and just doesn't seem like himself. falling to the 1st percentile for bmi could just be a growth spurt-related change, but combined with frequent illnesses and a long-lasting fever, it might be worth discussing further with your pediatrician.

the hemoglobin value from july is a bit low for a 6-year-old,  but not necessarily alarming on its own. however, given his recurring infections, it would be interesting to see what his complete blood count (cbc) would be now. and yes, it's quite normal for lymphocytes to be high and neutrophils low in infants and young children, so if that cbc was from his 1-year check, it's likely not an issue.

it's also important to remember that while antibiotics play an important role in treating bacterial infections, they can also affect gut health and possibly contribute to weight loss, especially when used multiple times over a short period. 

additionally, prolonged or recurrent fever could be related to many conditions, including infections, immunological disorders, malignancies, or other systemic diseases. persistent fever and weight loss certainly suggest the need for additional evaluation.

follow your instincts; you know your child best. don't hesitate to bring these issues up to your child's doctor, ask for a cbc or other necessary tests, and request referrals to specialists if necessary. they are your partners in health and it’s essential to maintain good communication.

also, i highly recommend the use of telemedicine services in between visits, to discuss any concerns directly with healthcare providers. this can be an excellent resource for rapid and convenient medical advice.  

lastly, always trust your instincts as a parent. if you feel something is not right, it is completely fine to seek further advice."
N202,response_16,"i'm an ai, not a doctor, but i can give you a general outline of what you might want to consider. any time your child has prolonged symptoms or changes that worry you, it's important to discuss them with their healthcare provider. if his symptoms persist, you could discuss more extensive testing such as cbc with his doctor to identify any potential issues. his low hemoglobin could be due a variety of issues such as nutritional deficiency or chronic disease. similarly, weight loss in a child can be a result of numerous things, including but not limited to infections, metabolic conditions, or gastrointestinal disorders.

his multiple infections in a short span of time could signify a weakened immune system. also, the high lymphocyte and low neutrophil count could indicate an issue depending on the exact numbers and context. please bring all these observations to your child's healthcare provider, who can then properly examine, diagnose and treat the issue accordingly.

remember, you are not being a hypochondriac. as a parent, it's your job to advocate for your child's health. you know your child best and if you have a feeling that something is not right, it's important you communicate that to the healthcare provider."
N202,response_17,"i'm an ai language model and not a doctor, but i can suggest a few considerations based on your concerns.

continual sickness in children, especially along with symptoms like weight loss and high fevers, should definitely be monitored by a healthcare provider. it's important to share these observations with your son's pediatrician, especially because this is a change from his usual health. 

the changes in blood values alone may not be significant, especially with the older values, but could become significant if they correlate with his recurring illness. a low hemoglobin number (anemia) can sometimes point to an underlying health issue. it could indicate nutritional deficiencies, but could also be indicative of other illnesses.

talking to your doctor about performing a new cbc (complete blood count) test could be beneficial, especially noting all the recurring symptoms and illnesses your son has been experiencing. it's important to monitor his weight considering the drop in bmi. this could be reflective of a serious issue, or it could simply be due to the fact that your son has been sick more often and possibly eating less.

always trust your instincts as a mom. if you feel something isn't right, keep bringing it up to healthcare providers until you feel you've received comprehensive care and answers. you are your child's best advocate. 

remember, only a healthcare professional can provide the necessary guidance. this advice should be used as a starting point for the next conversation with your doctor. it's important to include them in these discussions and decisions about your child's health. 

you're doing a great job as a mom, and i hope this helps ease some of your concerns even as you pursue a better understanding of your son's health situation."
N202,response_18,"i'm an ai language model and not a doctor, but i can try to provide you with some general advice. first, it's very important to trust your instincts as a parent. if you feel that something is not right with j's health, don't hesitate to bring up these concerns with your pediatrician. persistent fevers, constant infections, and significant weight loss could be concerning signs, and it's essential that these are appropriately investigated.

take note of all the issues you've mentioned, including the recurrent infections, weight loss, persistent fever, iron deficiency, and any changes in his blood work, and discuss these with his doctor. the doctor may perform other tests like a complete blood count (cbc) and serology, assess his nutritional status and growth, and perhaps refer you to a pediatric specialist, if necessary. they could also monitor his weight more closely to ensure he's on track with his growth.

remember that the reference ranges for certain blood counts may vary with age, so high lymphocytes and low neutrophils might not necessarily be a cause for concern in a 1-year old. however, it is always best to check this with a healthcare professional to make sure.

again, this advice is based on general principles and it's always safest and most accurate to consult with your doctor or a medical professional. they understand your son's history and can provide advice specific to his case."
N202,response_19,"i'm a virtual assistant and not a doctor, but i can tell you that you're not a hypochondriac for being concerned about your child's health; it's natural for a parent to worry about these things. it's a good idea to communicate your concerns to your doctor; they'll be able to give appropriate advice and might consider doing more extensive tests like a cbc to figure out what might be going on. persistent infections, weight loss, and high fever are all significant symptoms that deserve a closer look, especially considering your child's history of asthma. make sure to mention all these to your doctor during your next conversation. it's always better to talk to a healthcare professional about health-related concerns as they can provide the most accurate advice."
N202,response_20,"i'm an ai language model and can't provide personalized medical advice, but i can say that it's completely understandable to be concerned, and it's always a good idea to have these types of discussions with your child's doctor. prolonged fever, weight loss, repeated infections, and a change in behavior could suggest there's something more happening than regular childhood sicknesses. 

you, as the parent, often have the most comprehensive perspective on your child's overall condition. while doctors are experts in analyzing individual symptoms and test results, you're the one who sees all the changes and patterns over time. 

putting all of the symptoms together, as you have done, can suggest different hypotheses for the cause, and you might ask your doctor whether these make sense. some possibilities could be an immune system issue impacting his ability to fend off infections, a nutritional or malabsorption problem causing his weight loss and anemia, or a systemic infection that's not being completely cleared by the antibiotics. 

a complete blood count (cbc) might be useful in this case, as it can show your doctor a more detailed picture of your child's immune function, help identify hidden infections, and also determine if the anemia is getting worse. 

a good relationship with your pediatrician should involve open communication. you should trust that your concerns will be taken seriously, and that you will be guided through understanding the results of any necessary tests. don't be afraid to ask for explanations or question anything that seems incorrect or incomplete.

and remember, if your child's condition changes abruptly or worsens, seek immediate medical attention."
N202,response_21,"it sounds like you're really concerned about your son, and that's understandable. i'd strongly recommend discussing these matters with his doctor. you aren't being a hypochondriac; you're concerned about your child's health which is completely understandable, especially when there are clear symptoms like fever, weight loss, and frequent infections.

regarding the blood cell counts, it's difficult to make an assessment without knowing the exact numbers and trends, and also considering the clinical context. an isolated cbc at 1 year old may not reflect his current status, especially after 5 years have passed. 

regarding j's weight, it's reasonable to bring up this concern with your pediatrician as well. depending upon his symptoms, activity level, diet, and growth pattern, the pediatrician should be able to determine if the weight loss is of concern.

children do go through periods of frequent illness, particularly when they're exposed to other kids, such as in school or daycare. the infections you listed (hand, foot, mouth disease and strep throat) are commonly seen in kids, especially in certain seasons of the year. but, the high and persistent fever and weight loss are definitely something i would discuss with his doctor. they may decide to repeat the cbc or order other testing based on his symptoms and their physical examination.

trust your instincts and don't hesitate to ask questions or bring up concerns to your doctor. without knowing all the specifics and being a part of the medical consultation, it's difficult for me to draw conclusions, but it sounds like you should definitely continue to seek a good understanding of his condition from his healthcare provider."
N202,response_22,"i'm really sorry to hear that your little one is not feeling well. it's always concerning as a parent when you see your child in pain or discomfort.

as an ai, i don't have the ability to physically examine a patient or read emotional nuances in a situation, but i can provide some insight based on the details you provided. that being said, always consult your pediatrician when in doubt. in this situation, it could help to communicate your concerns as clearly as possible to them. 

suspicion of recurrent infections, weight loss, and chronic fever can definitely warrant further testing, such as a cbc. high lymphocyte and low neutrophil counts can sometimes indicate an infection or other issues, like an immune system disorder. however, this is not always the case especially considering that absolute values can be important too. 

iron deficiency anemia might explain some of the symptoms like fatigue, pica, and maybe even recurrent infections. here it's important to understand that just having iron-rich food may not be enough if there's some problem with iron absorption in the gut.

additionally, while there are lots of reasons for kids being skinny some of them potentially serious like celiac disease, malabsorption, etc., some kids are just skinny too. you might want to keep a closer eye on any changes in your child's diet, his overall energy levels, and his mood. 

make sure you voice your worries clearly to your pediatrician; together you can work out what might need to be addressed, and how. don't hesitate to ask for a second opinion either, if you feel it's needed. trust your instincts - you know your child best! i hope j feels better soon!"
N202,response_23,"i'm not a doctor, but i strongly suggest seeking the advice of a medical professional, either your child's pediatrician or possibly a specialist if necessary. frequent sickness, uncontrolled fever, and weight loss could be a sign of something more serious going on with his immune system.

his past test results might not be that significant on their own, but given the ongoing issues you have described, they are worth discussing with his doctor. 

a complete blood count (cbc) test could be helpful for giving the doctors a more in-depth look at his overall health, especially his immune system function.

taking notes and keeping track of his health history, symptoms, and past test results is important as it could help his doctor make a more accurate diagnosis. it's not being a hypochondriac, it's being an attentive, proactive parent.

make sure to share all your concerns with his doctor during his next visit, or consider asking for a second opinion if you don't feel your concerns are being adequately addressed. at the end of the day, you know your child best and your instincts are valuable.

you can also look into arranging a consultation with a pediatric infectious disease specialist or a pediatric immunologist, who specialize in children's immune systems.

please ensure to seek professional medical advice."
N202,response_24,"i'm really sorry to hear that your little one is not feeling well. it's tough seeing our children unwell and even more so when we don't exactly know what's wrong.

from what you've described there are a few red flags, including frequent illness, weight loss, low hemoglobin and continued fever despite antibiotics. it might be wise to discuss these concerns with your son's doctor, they may decide to order a complete blood count (cbc) as well as some other tests that might be needed to rule out any underlying condition, such as immune disorders, metabolic disorders or gastrointestinal problems that could be affecting his health.

you're not being a hypochondriac, you're being a caring parent who knows their child. trust your instincts and continue to advocate for your son."
N202,response_25,"i'm an ai language model and not a doctor, but i can say that if you have concerns about your child's health, it's absolutely appropriate to discuss these with his healthcare provider. a recent significant weight loss and recurring infections could potentially suggest some kind of underlying issue that needs to be addressed. it's possible that your doctor will want to run further tests or possibly refer you to a specialist to investigate what could be causing these symptoms. 

if you feel that your worries aren't being heard or taken seriously, it's perfectly okay to seek a second opinion. after all, you know your child best and it's important to ensure that he's getting the proper medical attention he needs.

in the case of the abnormal blood counts you noticed from a while back, it's a good idea to discuss that with the doctor as well. sometimes abnormal blood counts could be due to transient issues or lab errors, but it's always safer to get clarification.

again, this advice is general and doesn't replace the advice of a healthcare provider, so please get in touch with your child’s doctor as soon as possible."
