N205,response_1,"the phenomenon you're describing is known as ""tensor tympani syndrome"". the tensor tympani is a small muscle in your ear that dampens noises produced from chewing and other loud, internal sounds. some people can control this muscle consciously, creating a rumbling or thundering sound in their ears. this is generally a harmless ability, although it can be concerning if it's involuntarily contracting or causing discomfort or pain. if so, you should consult with a doctor or audiologist."
N205,response_2,"yes, some people do experience the same thing you mentioned. it's due to the contraction of tensor tympani muscle in your ear. this muscle helps to dampen certain loud sounds that could hurt your eardrum, like the sound of your own chewing. when you voluntarily contract this muscle, it creates a rumbling sound which you can hear. not everybody can voluntarily control this muscle. it's nothing to worry about and is quite normal."
N205,response_3,"that muscle you're likely referring to is the tensor tympani muscle, a small muscle in the ear that can cause a low rumbling noise. when you flex this muscle voluntarily, it tightens the drumlike tympanic membrane, or eardrum. you hear the rumbling noise as a result.

this ability is called voluntary tensor tympani syndrome and it's not harmful. some people can control this muscle while others can't, much like being able to roll one's tongue. if the sound is continuous and interfering with your quality of life, it's best to consult an ear nose throat (ent) specialist for advice."
N205,response_4,"you are likely experiencing a phenomenon known as voluntary tensor tympani muscle contraction. the tensor tympani is a small muscle in your inner ear that dampens the vibration of your eardrum, which decreases the volume of sounds you hear. normally, itâ€™s an involuntary muscle, but some people can control it to some degree. when you contract the tensor tympani muscle, it creates a rushing or rumbling sound. this is typically harmless and is more of a curious phenomenon or trick than anything else."
N205,response_5,"what you're describing sounds like control over the tensor tympani muscle in your ear. this is a muscle within the ear that dampens the sounds of you chew to protect your ear drum. some people are able to voluntarily control this muscle, producing a rumbling or rushing sound. non-harmful and fairly common, the phenomenon is often referred to as ""ear rumbling."" it is perfectly harmless unless it's accompanied by pain, hearing loss, or other uncomfortable symptoms. if you're concerned, it's always best to consult with a healthcare professional."
N205,response_6,"what you're describing is often attributed to the contraction of the tensor tympani muscle which is located in your inner ear. this muscle assists in dampening loud sounds, such as those produced from chewing or background noise. some people can voluntarily control this muscle causing a low rumbling sound. however, if you experience this often, or if it's accompanied with pain, hearing loss, or dizziness, it would be wise to consult a healthcare professional to rule out any underlying conditions like tinnitus or eustachian tube dysfunction."
N205,response_7,"what you're experiencing is likely the result of tensing your tensor tympani muscle, a muscle within the inner ear. this muscle, when it contracts, helps to reduce the amplitude of sound vibrations that reach your inner ear, such as the sound of you chewing. some people are able to voluntarily contract this muscle, generating a rumbling or rushing sound. this isn't harmful, just unusual. however, it is always best to consult a doctor if you have any concerns about a new or mysterious health symptom to get an appropriate diagnosis and treatment."
N205,response_8,"what you're experiencing is called ""tensor tympani syndrome"". the tensor tympani is a muscle within the ear that responds to loud sounds as a way of protecting the ear from potential damage. in some individuals, they are able to voluntarily control this muscle which causes this vibrating or rumbling sound. this is completely harmless and typically not associated with any condition."
N205,response_9,"the phenomenon you are describing is closely associated with deliberate tensing or flexing of a muscle called the tensor tympani muscle, which is located near your ear and helps dampen the vibration of loud sounds to protect your inner ear.

people who voluntarily contract this muscle may hear a low-frequency rumbling noise, which is described by some as a 'rushing' or 'ringing' sound. this contraction can sometimes be stimulated unconsciously by certain head or eye movements, yawning, or even anxiety.

it's worth noting that while most people can't do this voluntarily, the ability to do so doesn't seem to be harmful or indicative of any health problem. if you find the noise bothersome or are concerned, it might be best to consult with your doctor or an audiologist."
N205,response_10,"what you are experiencing is a voluntary contraction of the tensor tympani muscle in your ear. this muscle is usually responsive to loud sounds, helping to dampen them and protect your hearing. most people are not able to control this muscle voluntarily, but a few - about 10% of the population - can do so. when this muscle contracts, it can cause a rumbling or ringing sound. this is not harmful in any way. however, if you are experiencing persistent ringing or other ear-related symptoms, it might be best to consult with a healthcare professional to rule out any underlying conditions."
N205,response_11,"what you're describing is quite common and is related to a muscle called the tensor tympani muscle, a tiny muscle located in the middle ear that helps dampen loud noises. normally, this muscle contracts (tightens) in response to loud sounds, physical contact with the ear, or even intense emotions. some people can voluntarily control this muscle to produce the rushing or ringing sound as you've described, a phenomenon often called ""ear rumbling."" it's not harmful and is just one of many ways our bodies can surprise us with its individual quirks!"
N205,response_12,"the ability to voluntarily control a muscle (tensor tympani) in the ear and cause a low rumbling sound is fairly rare but not unheard of. some people can control it, while others may experience the same phenomenon involuntarily during yawning or when closing the eyes tightly. it essentially involves tensing the tensor tympani muscle, reducing the transmission of certain sound vibrations to the eardrum and inner ear. you are not alone in this, many people can do something similar, even if they weren't aware it was due to that specific muscle. if it's causing any discomfort or distress, it's best to discuss it with a doctor or audiologist."
N205,response_13,"what you're describing sounds like you're voluntarily contracting the tensor tympani, a muscle within the ear. when this muscle tightens, it dampens the vibrations coming from sound waves to protect the eardrum from excessively loud noise. most people can't consciously control this muscle, but some can, and they experience a kind of internal rumbling, rushing, or ringing sound when they do. this ability is harmless. however, if you are experiencing any discomfort, changes in your hearing, or if this sound is occurring without your voluntary control, it would be wise to consult with a healthcare professional to rule out tinnitus or other conditions."
N205,response_14,"this movement and sound is likely caused by the tensor tympani muscle in your ear. it's a small muscle that is typically involved in dampening the sounds of chewing or loud noises. some people can voluntarily control this muscle and create a rumbling or rushing noise in their ears, a phenomenon known as ""voluntary tensor tympani syndrome."" it's quite harmless and a large number of people actually have this ability."
N205,response_15,"what you're experiencing may be due to involuntary contractions in one of the muscles of the inner ear, known as the tensor tympani muscle. when this muscle contracts, it can cause a rumbling or thundering sound, which some people describe as similar to the sound when you close your eyes extremely hard or flex your jaw muscles. this is commonly referred to as ""voluntary rumbling"".

not everyone can consciously control this muscle, but for those who can, it's usually a harmless symptom. however, frequent or constant muscle contractions could potentially indicate an underlying health issue like a muscle disorder, tinnitus, or middle ear muscle spasm. 

if you're experiencing discomfort or it's affecting your everyday life, it would be recommended to see a healthcare professional or an ent specialist."
N205,response_16,"you're not alone; what you're experiencing is a fairly common phenomenon. the muscle you're manipulating is likely the tensor tympani muscle, a tiny muscle in your inner ear. when you contract this muscle, it reduces the amount of vibrations reaching your ear drums, creating a rumbling or rushing sound. normally, this muscle contracts in response to loud noises as a kind of defense mechanism. some people, however, can voluntarily control this muscle, which seems to be what you're experiencing. 

remember, while it's generally harmless to flex this muscle occasionally, if you notice any changes in your hearing or feel any pain, you should consult a healthcare professional. garnier malet says that overuse can potentially lead to tinnitus, or ringing in the ears."
N205,response_17,"the phenomenon you're describing may be related to the tensor tympani muscle in your ear. this is a tiny muscle in the middle ear that helps dampen loud noises. when this muscle is volitionally contracted, it can create a sensation akin to a rumble, or what you described as a rushing/ringing sound. this exercising/stimulation of the tensor tympani muscle is harmless, although it's not something every individual can consciously do. if this sensation is troubling you or becoming persistent without your control, i recommend reaching out to a healthcare provider to undergo proper examination."
N205,response_18,"this phenomenon is often called ""voluntary eustachian tube control."" the tensor tympani muscle, which is located above the auditory tube, responds to sudden loud sounds by reflex contraction. for some people, this can be voluntarily controlled, leading to a rumbling or rushing sound. the eustachian tubes help regulate the pressure inside your ear, and when you have them open, you might hear a buzzing or feel a ""clicking"" sensation. although this ability is uncommon, it is not typically a cause for concern unless accompanied by pain, hearing loss, or other symptoms. if you have any concerns related with this, you should consult with a healthcare provider or ear, nose and throat (ent) specialist."
N205,response_19,"this is quite common and is often referred to as ""ear rumbling"". the muscle responsible for it is called the tensor tympani muscle. normally, this muscle acts to dampen the noise produced from chewing or other loud, unexpected sounds, but some people can consciously control it to produce the rumbling sound. it is perfectly harmless. however, if you are experiencing any pain or discomfort, you should seek medical advice."
N205,response_20,"you have just described a phenomenon known as voluntary tensor tympani syndrome. the tensor tympani is a muscle within the ear that reacts to loud noises as part of your body's acoustic reflex, which helps protect your ears from large changes in sound pressure generated from loud noises. this muscle normally dampens the vibrations caused by very loud sounds in order to protect the inner ear. 

some people, however, have the ability to voluntarily contract this muscle, producing a rumbling or rushing sound. the sound is often equated to the sound made when you close your eyes very tightly. not everyone is able to deliberately control this muscle. for some, it only contracts involuntarily in response to loud sounds, sudden changes in ear pressure, or even during certain parts of a yawn."
N205,response_21,"this sound like tensor tympani syndrome. the tensor tympani is a muscle within the ear that reacts to loud noises in order to protect the eardrum. some people are able to voluntarily control this muscle, and when tensed, it can create a low rumble or drumming sound in the ear. this is typically harmless and really just a bit inconvenient. if it is causing discomfort or distress, however, speaking to a doctor would be a good step."
N205,response_22,"the muscle you're controlling is likely the tensor tympani muscle. it's a muscle within the ear that dampens the sounds of chewing and other loud noises. when you intentionally flex this muscle, it can produce a rumbling or rushing sound. although not everyone is knowingly able to do this, it is completely normal and generally harmless. however, if the sound becomes persistent or is associated with pain, it may be in your best interest to consult a medical professional, as it could be a symptom of tinnitus or another auditory condition."
N205,response_23,"the muscle you're describing is likely the tensor tympani muscle, a small muscle in the middle ear that dampens the noise produced by chewing or other loud sounds. the sound you hear when you intentionally flex this muscle is often described as a rumbling or thunder sound. this is sometimes also referred to as voluntary control of the tensor tympani muscle, which is a relatively rare but harmless ability. 

however, it's always advisable to consult with a healthcare professional if you're experiencing anything unusual or uncomfortable in order to rule out any potential health concerns."
N205,response_24,"you're likely using your tensor tympani muscles! it's a muscle in the ear that dampens the sounds produced by chewing or other loud, internal noises. many people can voluntarily contract this muscle and doing so produces a rumbling sound in the ear. it's a completely normal and harmless action. most people only notice this sounds when yawning or swallowing, but some can produce it at will."
N205,response_25,"what you are experiencing is likely voluntary control over your tensor tympani muscle. this muscle is located in the middle ear. by flexing and relaxing this muscle, you can control the tension on your eardrum. when you tense this muscle, it dampens the vibrations from sound waves reaching your inner ear, causing you to hear a low rumbling or ""rushing"" sound. this ability is not harmful and is something that a small percentage of people can do."
