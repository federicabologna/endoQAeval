N96,response_1,"it's completely normal to worry about our health, and it's good that you are thinking about cancer prevention and early detection. cancer screening recommendations often depend on your individual risk factors, such as family history, certain genetic mutations, lifestyle factors like tobacco and alcohol use, etc. 

usually, healthy individuals in their 20s are not counseled to get ""full body checkups"" or routine screenings for various cancers because the risks of the screening tests (including false-positive results and unnecessary interventions) often outweigh the potential benefits for people with no symptoms and low risk factors.

however, it's important to seek help if you have any specific symptoms that worry you or if you have a family history of certain cancers. it's also essential to maintain a healthy lifestyle, including a balanced diet and regular exercise, as well as healthy habits such as avoiding smoking or excessive drinking.

for your mental well-being, you might benefit from discussing your health anxieties with your gp. they can help you understand your actual health risks and can provide reassurance about your fears. 

while guidelines vary, depending on authority and country, here are some general ages when certain cancer screenings usually start for people at average risk:

- breast cancer: mammograms are recommended starting at age 50 with some variance on earlier start.
- colorectal cancer: screening often starts at age 50, but it may be recommended earlier for people with certain risk factors.
- cervical cancer: pap tests often start at age 21.
- prostate cancer: screenings (if they're done at all) often start around age 50.

remember that health guidelines may vary depending on various factors. speak to your healthcare provider to get the best advice."
N96,response_2,"i'm not a doctor but i could give you some advice based on health guidelines. it seems that specific types of cancer screenings begin at certain ages or are recommended for individuals with specific risk factors. 

for example, it's recommended that women start having regular breast cancer screenings (mammograms) starting at age 50, or 40 if they are at higher risk. for colon cancer, the recommended age to start having regular colonoscopies is 50 (or earlier if you have certain risk factors). for prostate cancer screening in men, the common starting age is 50, or 45 for those at higher risk.

for individuals in their 20s, unless you have certain symptoms or high risk factors (such as a family history of cancer), comprehensive cancer screenings are often not recommended because the likelihood of having cancer at this age is quite low.

however, you should certainly bring up your concerns with your healthcare provider. they can help determine whether screening is appropriate based on your specific health fears, circumstances and family medical history.

keep in mind that general checkups can also catch many health issues, so it's a good idea to have those periodically. a general checkup might include blood tests, blood pressure checks, and potentially other tests.

being proactive about your health is always a good thing, but it’s also important to make sure your anxieties aren't causing you unnecessary stress.

again, please consult with your doctor for the most accurate information."
N96,response_3,"firstly, it's crucial to remember that only a healthcare provider should give individualized medical advice. your anxiety about your health is a valid concern and it's great that you’re proactive about it.

however, routine full body scans or checkups for cancer are usually not recommended for individuals who are at an average risk and with no symptoms. unnecessary screenings could lead to harm such as overdiagnosis and overtreatment.

certain screenings are recommended based on age and risk factors for different types of cancers. for example, a woman of a certain age may be invited to have regular breast and cervical screenings, while a man may be advised to have prostate screenings, and so on.

if you're worried about health problems like cancer or heart disease, a better approach might be to focus on maintaining a healthy lifestyle - nutritious diet, regular exercise, no smoking, etc. - and having regular check-ups with your doctor. 

your doctor can provide you advice on screenings based on your risk factors including family history and lifestyle. for your anxiety, consider talking to a professional as well, they can provide options that can help you manage or diminish it."
N96,response_4,"the nhs recommends routine screenings for certain types of cancer, like breast, cervical and colorectal cancers, at specific ages usually starting from 25, 50, or 60 if you're generally healthy and don't have a strong family history of a specific type of cancer. that being said, it’s also important to be aware of your body and any changes that occur. if you notice anything unusual, it’s recommended to consult your gp regardless of age.

however, if anxiety about your health is causing you significant distress, it may be beneficial to speak to a mental health professional. they can provide you with strategies to manage your anxiety and may also reassure you about your health concerns. 

remember, online advice is not a substitute for professional medical advice. always discuss health concerns and screening recommendations with your healthcare provider."
N96,response_5,"typically, cancer screenings start from ages 20-40 depending on the type of cancer and risk. some of the most common screenings include:

1. breast cancer: starting from age 40-50, annual mammogram screenings are recommended for women. however, if you have a family history, screenings may start earlier.

2. testicular cancer: men, particularly between ages 20-39, are advised to conduct self-examinations for any irregularities.

3. colon cancer: screenings usually start at age 50 unless you have a family history or other risk factors.

4. cervical cancer: for women, regular pap tests start at age 21.

5. lung cancer: screenings are generally recommended for those aged 55 to 80 who have a heavy smoking history.

6. prostate cancer: starting from age 50, or 45 if you're at higher risk, regular screenings are recommended for men. 

however, if you have persistent symptoms that worry you, regardless of your age, it is always worthwhile to discuss these concerns with your doctor. it's essential to remember that the presence of symptoms does not necessarily mean you have cancer. other conditions may cause these symptoms as well, but the only way to know for sure is to see a health care professional.

ensuring you lead a healthy lifestyle (balanced nutrition, regular exercise, no smoking, etc.) can also significantly decrease your chances of developing many cancers. 

as the guidelines for cancer screenings may vary, it is recommended to discuss with your general practitioner about what screening tests might be suitable for you based on your age, medical history, and family history."
N96,response_6,"go for regular visits to your primary care physician and bring up your concerns. they can help assess your risk factors and decide whether screening tests are appropriate. in general, screenings for certain types of cancer (like breast, colon, and prostate cancer) start at middle age. but there could be reasons to do them earlier, particularly if you've a family history of cancer or other risk factors.

however, it's important to note that ""finding cancer early"" isn't always as helpful as it may seem. not all cancers are the same -- some grow slowly and may never cause symptoms or shorten life, while others grow rapidly and are life-threatening. in some cases, finding and treating cancer early can lead to unnecessary treatment with serious side effects.

therefore, don't hesitate to talk about your concerns during your regular primary care visits and make sure your physician is aware of your health history and concerns. however, if you're experiencing specific symptoms that worry you, definitely do not hesitate to contact your doctor at any time.

consultation with a mental health professional regarding your health anxiety may also be beneficial.

but please remember this advice doesn't replace direct medical consultation."
N96,response_7,"cancer screening at an early age can be beneficial, but depends largely on personal risk factors, such as family history, lifestyle choices, and presence of specific symptoms. for example, the nhs in uk invites women for cervical screening from 25, and both men and women are invited to bowel cancer screening from their 50s.

however, given your anxiety about health issues, a whole body checkup may help reassure you. it's always worth discussing your fears with your general practitioner to see if they recommend specific test for your peace of mind. keep in mind that certain screenings carry their own risks and false positives can be stressful, so it's best to talk this through with your healthcare provider. 

above all, healthy lifestyle choices and regular exercise can help reduce the risk of certain types of cancer. also, get to know your body. if you notice any changes, such as an unexplained lump or mole, unexplained tiredness, weight loss, or blood in your urine or faeces, seek medical advice promptly."
N96,response_8,"generally, doctors suggest starting regular checkups for common cancers around the age of 40 to 50. however, if you have a family history of certain types of cancer or other risk factors, you may need to start earlier. 

since you mentioned you have health anxiety, it might be beneficial for you to see a doctor to talk about your concerns. they can provide reassurance, advice on ways to reduce your risk, and information about age-appropriate tests. further, regular physical check-ups are generally recommended for adults of all ages to catch potential health concerns early. additionally, consider counseling or therapy to help with your anxiety if you haven't already. 

keep in mind, this advice is general in nature, and you should always consult your healthcare provider for information tailored to your specific situation."
N96,response_9,"in the uk, routine cancer screening programs start at different ages for different types of cancers, and are usually based on your risk levels related to factors like age and sex. 

1. breast screening: women aged 50 to 70 are invited for mammograms every 3 years.
2. cervical screening: women and people with a cervix aged 25 to 64 are invited for cervical screening (previously known as a ""smear test"") every 3 or 5 years.
3. bowel cancer screening: men and women aged 60 to 74 are invited to carry out a home test kit every 2 years.
4. prostate cancer: there is currently no national screening program due to controversy over the test's effectiveness.

at your age, it is not common to conduct a full cancer screening unless there is a high risk (like family history or certain genetic factors). however, if you're experiencing symptoms that you are worried about, it’s always worth discussing with a medical professional, regardless of your age. 

moreover, it's helpful to inform yourself about different cancer symptoms, which can sometimes be vague or similar to symptoms of less serious conditions. knowing your body and understanding what is normal for you can help you recognise when something isn't right.

for your health anxiety issues, cognitive-behavioral therapy or consulting a mental health professional may be beneficial. regular health check-ups in line with your age and health status can also help reassure you. remember, in most cases, tests and screenings are not done unless they are deemed necessary by a healthcare professional. far from reassuring you, unnecessary tests can sometimes lead to false positives and cause more anxiety."
N96,response_10,"firstly, it's important to note that health anxiety or hypochondria can be quite debilitating and often requires its own specialized form of treatment, typically cognitive-behavioral therapy or similar psychological therapies.

regarding cancer screening, there are different guidelines for different types of cancers. some screenings start early, such as cervical cancer screening for women who should begin at 25 in the uk, while others start later in life, like bowel cancer screening which begins at 50. it really depends on your risk factors - if you have a strong family history of a certain type of cancer, for example, your doctor may recommend you start screening at an earlier age.

routine ""full body"" check ups for cancer are not usually recommended because they can lead to over-diagnosis and unnecessary procedures. we also don't have good screening measures for a lot of cancers. so, they are typically reserved for people with certain risk factors, like a strong family history.

however, if you're experiencing unexplained symptoms or if your anxiety is overwhelming, you should definitely arrange an appointment with your gp. they can provide reassurance, order any necessary tests and refer you to mental health services if needed.

do note that a balanced diet, regular exercise, moderating alcohol, avoiding smoking, and regularly applying sunscreen can help to prevent a range of cancers. discuss with your gp about times and regularity of these check-ups. this is not medical advice and always consult your personal healthcare provider."
N96,response_11,"you're correct in that there is a lot of mixed information out there. in general, it's not so much about a ""right age"" to start going in for cancer screenings, but rather based on your personal risk factors. medical guidelines generally recommend certain screenings (like for breast cancer, prostate cancer, or colon cancer) to begin at around 40 or 50 respectively, though this is individualized based on personal and family medical history. 

however, seeing as you're experiencing quite a bit of health anxiety, it may be beneficial to have a comprehensive health check up. this isn't necessarily to check for cancer, but rather to address your medical-related anxieties, and have a good baseline understanding of your overall health. from there, your gp may have specific recommendations based on their findings. 

there's also psychological support available to help manage anxiety, including cognitive behavioral therapy or mindfulness-based approaches. these can help you to manage your hypochondria, and hopefully help you live a better, less anxiety-driven life. 

so while there isn't a set age, if you're concerned it's worth bringing this up with your gp to discuss your options and what would be best given your current health status, family history and personal concerns."
N96,response_12,"it's completely okay to feel anxious about your health. most guidelines suggest regular cancer screenings start from age 50, however, it highly depends on individual health and family history. in your 20s, the most common cancers may be testicular cancer, thyroid cancer, or leukemia, although these are still relatively rare.

however, if you have specific symptoms that worry you or if there's a family history of certain types of cancer, it may be worth discussing it with your gp. they can suggest if you need any tests or screenings even at your younger age.

moreover, instead of focusing specifically on cancer, it might be more productive to maintain regular annual physical checkups that include evaluations of your overall health status, blood tests to check for any deficiencies or issues, as well as discussions about any concerns you have.

remember, the stress from worrying about potential health issues can itself lead to health problems - so it's important to maintain open dialogue with healthcare professionals, who can provide accurate, up to date information and help alleviate your concerns.

it may also be beneficial to seek help for your health anxiety, such as cognitive behavioral therapy or other types of psychological support."
N96,response_13,"firstly, it's important to consider your family history, as that can dictate when you should start getting regular screenings for certain types of cancer. for example, if there is a history of colorectal cancer in your family, you should get screened at an earlier age. additionally, certain lifestyle factors, like smoking or excessive sunlight exposure, can increase your cancer risk. 

generally in the uk, cancer screenings start at certain ages:
- breast cancer screening is currently offered to women aged 50-71, and is planned to be extended to 47-73 years.
- cervical cancer screening is offered to women aged 25-64.
- bowel cancer screening is offered to men and women aged 60-74.

however, for men, there isn't routine screening for prostate cancer or testicular cancer. prostate cancer would usually be checked if there is a family history or if the patient has urinary symptoms.

for your concern about heart problems, you can certainly discuss with your gp, they may check your blood pressure and other blood markers like cholesterol and blood sugar to evaluate cardiovascular risk. 

remember, consistent and severe symptoms should always warrant a check, no matter what age you are. it's also important to have regular check-ups with your gp, but ""full body check-ups"" specifically for cancer aren't common practice unless there's a serious, persistent symptom or a strong family history of a certain type of cancer.

i encourage you to speak to your gp about your health anxieties, they may be able to give you advice that helps alleviate these worries. also, utilizing support hotlines or considering therapy/counselling could be beneficial for handling health anxiety. 

this advice is just general and doesn't replace professional medical advice. always speak with your healthcare provider for advice suited to your individual circumstances."
N96,response_14,"in the uk, the nhs often starts screening for certain types of cancer from the age of 25 (like cervical cancer) and others from the age of 50 (like breast and bowel cancer). however, this does not mean you should not pay attention to your body, risk factors, and potential symptoms at a younger age.

your age, gender, lifestyle choices, family history and genetic factors can all influence your risk of developing cancer. if you notice any concerning symptoms or changes to your body, regardless of your age, you should always inform your doctor.

anxiety about health is very real and should also be discussed with your health providers. your worry could actually increase your stress level. it would be good to have a discussion with your gp or a mental health professional about your anxiety.

in the end, even if you're young and healthy, regular health checkups are a good idea. they can help catch potential problems early and keep track of any changes over time."
N96,response_15,"it's important to discuss your concerns about cancer with your healthcare provider given the personal stress you're experiencing, rather than waiting until a certain age to get screened. however, screening for certain types of cancer isn't generally recommended until the age of 40 or 50, unless you have specific risk factors (such as certain genetic mutations or a family history of cancer).

here's a rough guide for when you might start considering certain screenings, in the absence of symptoms:

1. breast cancer: for women, mammograms are typically recommended starting at age 40 to 50.
2. colon cancer: both men and women should start regular screenings at age 50, unless they have a family history of colon cancer or other risk factors, in which case they might start earlier.
3. cervical cancer: for women, pap tests are usually recommended starting at age 21.
4. prostate cancer: for men, screenings are generally suggested starting around age 50, although those with a family history of the disease may start at age 45 or earlier.
5. lung cancer: men and women who have a history of heavy smoking are usually screened starting at age 55.

as you can see, most cancer screenings are not started until 40 or later, and many are specific to gender. however, if you are experiencing symptoms or have certain risk factors, screenings can be performed earlier. 

keep in mind also that a large component of reducing cancer risk is maintaining a healthy lifestyle: abstaining from smoking, getting regular physical activity, maintaining a healthy weight, and eating a balanced diet can all help reduce your risk. regular check-ups with your doctor to monitor your overall health are also valuable.

while it's good to be aware of your health, excessive worry can also have a negative impact. you may want to discuss your health anxiety with a mental health expert as well. health anxiety can be treated, and support from a mental health professional could help you manage your fears more effectively."
N96,response_16,"there's no definitive age for cancer screenings as it largely depends on individual risk factors like family history of cancer, lifestyle habits (smoking, unhealthy diet, exposure to harmful substances, etc.), and symptoms. 

in the uk, certain routine screenings start at a particular age. for example, breast cancer screening is offered to women aged 50 to 70, cervical screening is offered to women aged 25 to 64, and bowel cancer screening is offered to men and women aged 55 or over.

don't ignore any unusual symptoms you are feeling. if you are experiencing symptoms that you are worried about, regardless of your age, consult a doctor right away. the symptoms might not necessarily be cancer, but getting checked would help alleviate your anxiety. 

furthermore, if you have strong anxiety about your health, talking to a mental health professional can also be helpful.

but remember, generally in 20s and 30s, unless there's a strong genetic predisposition or specific symptoms, the risk for most types of cancer is low. regular self-checks and awareness of what is normal for your own body are vital at every age. 

please consult this with a healthcare professional who knows your medical history and current situation for best advice."
N96,response_17,"it's important to schedule routine physical exams and to be vigilant about any changes you notice in your body, but there is not typically a recommended age for full body cancer screenings for everyone because the risk of developing most types of cancers increases with age. however, individuals with a family history of certain cancers or other risk factors may need to start screening at a younger age. there are also certain cancer screenings advised at younger ages such as cervical screenings for women starting at age 25 in the uk, and testicular self-exams for men starting in their teens. 

while it's understandable to have health concerns, overly excessive worry might not be healthy as it can lead to stress and anxiety. if you are concerned and anxious about your health, it might be beneficial to discuss these feelings with a mental health professional. they can provide you with strategies to manage your health anxiety. 

if you are ever uncertain about your physical health, it's always a good idea to reach out to your physician. they can provide the best advice for you based on your personal and family medical history. additionally, incorporating a healthy lifestyle including regular exercise, a balanced diet, and routine checkups can contribute to overall well-being and potentially reduce the risk of chronic diseases like cancer and heart disease."
N96,response_18,"it's wise to be proactive about your health, but obsessing over potential diseases could lead to more harm than good, especially if your fears are based on anxiety rather than concrete symptoms. that said, while comprehensive cancer screenings are typically recommended start at the age of 50 or younger if you have a significant family history, it's important to stay up-to-date with regular check-ups and report any abnormal changes in your body to your doctor.

regular checks include things like visits to a dermatologist for skin checks, blood pressure monitoring, blood tests, cholesterol checks, dental health checks, eye health, and for women regular cervical smear tests and breast exams.

if you have specific symptoms that concerns you, it's always safer to consult a physician. however, remember that anxiety can also manifest as physical symptoms - which is often the case with hypochondriacs.

given your health anxiety, it might be beneficial to also seek support from mental health professionals who can help you handle this anxiety more effectively.

nhs offers excellent programs and resources for individuals struggling with health anxiety. in addition, they can also provide you with appropriate guidance related to preventive healthcare and screenings. they are best informed on the latest guidelines and can provide individual advice based on your personal and family medical history."
N96,response_19,"sorry to hear you're feeling this way, but it's important to start by saying that i'm an artificial intelligence and can't replace professional medical advice. regular screenings generally start at certain ages based on the type of cancer and level of risk associated with your age group. generally speaking, it's not common to give full body cancer screenings to young people in their mid twenties, unless they have a very high risk due to genetic factors or associated symptoms. if you're feeling anxious, speaking with a healthcare professional about your concerns would be the best step. they can provide you with accurate information based on your specific health and history."
N96,response_20,"it's understandable that you're anxious about these health risks, but it's essential to put them into perspective. most national guidelines don't recommend regular, full-body screening tests in people without any symptoms or family history of cancer. 

here are a few things to know:  

1) if there is a strong history of certain types of cancer in your family, you may need to be tested at a younger age. this could include tests like colonoscopies for colon cancer or mammograms for breast cancer based on the type and age of diagnosis in your family.

2) despite popular belief, there is no single test that can check for all types of cancer. each type of cancer has different methods of detection, and many of those methods can only be applied or find anything useful once symptoms have started showing. 

3) most types of cancers are extremely rare in people your age (though there are exceptions, like testicular cancer). other cancers become more of a risk as we get older, so most cancer screenings start at age 50 or later.

4) for some cancer types, the harms of the screenings themselves can outweigh the potential benefits if you aren't at a specific risk (due to family history or exposure to certain toxins, for example). false positives can lead to unnecessary and harmful treatments or procedures, and the anxiety that comes from false positives can also take a toll on your mental health.

if you're really worried about this, talk to your gp. they can help assess your risk for different types of cancer and let you know which screenings, if any, might be beneficial for you. they can also help you understand more about the signs and symptoms of different types of cancer so you can be alert for any changes in your body.

and lastly, that you're anxious about your health to this extent indicates you might benefit from therapy or counselling, particularly cognitive behavioural therapy, which can be very effective at treating health anxiety."
N96,response_21,"it's generally not necessary for a healthy, asymptomatic person in their 20s to get a full body cancer screen unless they are at high risk due to a significant family history or specific genetic conditions. common cancer screenings such as for breast, colon, and cervical cancers generally don't begin until later in life. 

however, it is always a good idea to have regular general health checkups, usually on a yearly basis. during these regular checkups, your doctor can check for signs and symptoms of disease, including certain types of cancer.

men, in particular, are encouraged to start routine screenings for prostate and testicular cancers from their 40s or 50s onward. however, if you are overly concerned or feel you are at a higher risk due to family history, you should definitely speak with your healthcare provider about your concerns. 

you are also encouraged to make lifestyle choices that can help reduce your risk of cancer (quit smoking, eat a healthy diet, exercise regularly, maintain a healthy weight, protect yourself from the sun and so on). 

i must add that it's very important to speak to your healthcare provider about your health anxieties and possibly consider seeking help for managing hypochondria. chronic anxiety about your health can lead to unnecessary tests and procedures, high healthcare costs, and can even mask actual symptoms of disease. therapy can be very beneficial for managing health anxiety."
N96,response_22,"there's no definitive answer to an 'appropriate age' to get checked for cancer, as it depends on many factors, including family history, lifestyle habits, and any symptoms you may be experiencing. in the uk, there are several routine screenings offered, such as cervical screening for women over 25, but full-on cancer screenings across the board are generally not necessary unless there are specific concern or high risks.

if you're experiencing anxiety about your health, you should certainly discuss this with your gp. they can provide reassurance, conduct any necessary tests, and refer you to counseling or other treatments if needed. even if full-body cancer screenings aren't standard, there are other preventative health checkups you could ask your gp about, like blood pressure, cholesterol levels, or even simple blood tests that can reveal a lot about your overall health status.

also, consider talking to a health professional about your health anxiety. cognitive behavioral therapy, for example, can be especially helpful in managing health anxiety. it's also important to stay up-to-date with the health information from reliable sources, focus on living a healthy lifestyle, and try to manage your stress levels in effective ways. it's great to be proactive about your health, but it's also important to find a balance that doesn't leave you feeling anxious or distressed."
N96,response_23,"it depends on your personal health history, family history of cancer, and presence of specific risk factors. most cancer screening guidelines are based on age and risk factors. 

for example, in the uk, nhs offers breast screening for women aged 50 to 70 and bowel cancer screening for men and women aged 60 to 74. however, people with certain genetic conditions or a strong family history of certain cancers may be monitored more closely from a younger age.

if you have chronic anxieties about your health, it would be advisable to discuss these with your gp. they can help you understand your actual risk based on your personal and family history, and they could also refer you for support with your health anxiety if it's causing significant distress or affecting your quality of life. while it's good to be vigilant about changes in your body and to seek medical advice when you're unsure, unnecessary tests or procedures can also have negative effects, including the stress and anxiety of unnecessary worrying over results.

lastly, jot down any symptoms you are currently having and discuss these with your gp as well. they can help determine if further investigation is needed or reassure you if the symptoms are not typically associated with a serious condition. keep in mind also that maintaining a healthy lifestyle (regular exercise, balanced diet, not smoking, limited alcohol) can help reduce the risk of many diseases, including cancer."
N96,response_24,"it's good to hear that you're cautious about your health. in general, periodic health checkups are important and can help detect potential health issues before they become serious. however, when talking about cancer, the necessity and frequency of screenings largely depend on a person's individual risk factors like family history, lifestyle, exposure to certain substances, etc. 

for example, a man with a family history of prostate cancer might need to start getting screened earlier and more frequently than a man with no such history. similarly, a woman with a family history of breast cancer might start regular mammograms earlier than the general recommendation, which starts at age 50 in the uk.

for those with an average risk level, the nhs does offer routine screenings for certain types of cancer: 

1. breast cancer screening is offered to women aged 50 to 70.
2. bowel cancer screening is offered via home testing kits to people aged 60 to 74.
3. cervical screening is offered to women aged 25 to 64.

it's also important to note that any person, regardless of age, should promptly seek medical attention if they notice any concerning symptoms or changes in their body. 

you mentioned having health anxiety, a point that shouldn't be overlooked. if you are dealing with persistent fears about your health despite having no significant issues, you may benefit from therapy or counselling. cognitive behavioural therapy (cbt) can be especially effective for health anxiety. if you're worrying a lot and this is impacting your day-to-day life, my suggestion would be to talk to a healthcare professional about this first."
N96,response_25,"in the uk, the nhs provides routine cancer screening programmes for certain types of cancer (breast, cervical, and bowel) to specific age groups that are at higher risk due to age or gender.

for other types of cancer, there's no regular screening because there's no reliable, simple test that can pick it up in people who haven't got any symptoms. instead, they focus on raising awareness of the symptoms and encouraging people to see their doctor if they are experiencing something unusual for them.

however, this doesn't mean that young people like yourself can't get cancer. if you have any symptoms that concern you, it's always worth speaking to your gp about them, regardless of your age.

as for a full body checkup, there isn't really a one-size-fits-all answer. it would depend on many factors, including your current health situation, your family history, your lifestyle, and your concerns. remember, while it's good to take care of your health, it's also important not to become overly focused on it, as this can feed health anxiety.

you may find it helpful to discuss your health anxiety with your gp as well. they can provide you with the appropriate advice, and there are therapies available, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (cbt), which can help you manage the feelings of anxiety and reduce their impact on your life."
