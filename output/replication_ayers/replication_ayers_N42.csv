N42,response_1,"mononucleosis (also known as 'mono' or 'kissing disease') is an infection caused by the epstein-barr virus. it spreads through saliva and close contact, hence the nickname 'kissing disease'. some precautions you can take:

1. you can use the same shower, just make sure you are not using the same cleaning utensils or products. the virus doesn't survive long on objects, so it's unlikely to get infected from a shared bathroom.

2. avoid sharing cups, utensils or any object that goes in your roommate's mouth.

3. wearing a mask can help, but it's most essential when you're in close contact. however, in a shared living space, it might not be very effective in avoiding infection completely. 

4. it's difficult to predict the duration of the infectious period and it varies from person to person. as a general rule, one should take precautions until the roommate is symptom-free, this could range from few weeks to several months.

option of moving to a new room can be considered, especially if you have been frequently getting sick due to your roommate's habits. it might help not only to avoid mono, but also other potential infectious diseases.

overall, take appropriate preventive measures and if possible, discuss your concerns openly with your roommate. it's important to maintain good hygiene and healthy habits to boost your immune system. if you start experiencing symptoms such as a headache, fatigue, sore throat, fever, and swollen lymph nodes, it might be best to consult with a healthcare provider."
N42,response_2,"mononucleosis, also known as the ""kissing disease"", typically spreads through saliva. because it is not airborne like the flu or cold, proximity to someone with mono does not guarantee you will get the disease. that being said, it is still recommended to follow certain precautionary measures:

1. **sharing shower**: it's unlikely to contract mono from using a shared bathroom, including shower, if it's used at different times. proper washing and sanitizing of bath area would be recommended nonetheless. water droplets in the context of disease transmission typically refer to respiratory droplets, not water from shower.

2. **wearing a mask**: it may not be necessary unless the person with mono is coughing or sneezing a lot. wearing a mask can also provide some protection from sharing glassware or utensils accidentally.

3. **duration of precautions**: it can take 4 to 6 weeks for the symptoms of mono to disappear entirely. however, the virus can stay in the saliva for months after the symptoms are gone. 

4. **moving to a new room**: whether or not to move to a new room can depend on a variety of factors. mono is not highly contagious and so the decision to move may depend on how comfortable you are living with the current roommate, taking their lifestyle and behavior into account.

in general, avoid sharing drinks, food, or eating utensils with the infected person. ensure frequent and proper hand hygiene, and clean shared house items or surfaces regularly.

remember, if you have any specific medical concerns, consult a healthcare provider. this advice is intended to be general in nature, and specific causes can vary."
N42,response_3,"the ""kissing disease"" you are referring to is known as infectious mononucleosis (mono), which is most commonly caused by the epstein-barr virus. the primary ways it spreads is through saliva (hence, the name ""kissing disease""), sharing food or drinks, or by coughing or sneezing.

here are some things you can do:

1. showering: it should be safe to share a shower, but cleanup after use could be beneficial. although transmission through water droplets isn't the typical route of infection, general hygiene practices such as cleaning surfaces can help.

2. masks: wearing a mask in close quarters can help reduce the risk of transmission – especially if your roommate is coughing.

3. as for how long to take these precautions, individuals with mono can be infectious for many months. however, most people have been exposed to the virus by adulthood and are immune. you should talk to your doctor about your concerns.

4. regarding moving into a new room, if it is feasible, that might be your best option given your history of getting ill from your roommate. alternatively, request your roommate to maintain a decent level of hygiene, especially when it comes to common areas.

5. immunization: there's no vaccine to protect against the epstein-barr virus, but you can help protect yourself by not sharing personal items that could be contaminated with saliva.

if your roommate can manage their symptoms and adhere to precautions, you may not have to move out necessarily. remember, if you decide to stay, a combination of personal cleanliness, regular cleaning of shared spaces, and avoiding sharing utensils or other personal items can help keep you safe.

always consult a healthcare provider for advice tailored to your health situation."
N42,response_4,"when your roommate has mono, also known as the kissing disease (caused by the epstein-barr virus), there are several precautions you can take to avoid infection - especially given your close living environment. 

1. avoid sharing personal items: mono spreads through body fluids, typically saliva. avoid sharing items like cups, utensils, toothbrushes, or anything else that could have come in contact with your roommate's saliva. 

2. maintain hygiene: washing your hands often and avoiding close contact can also help prevent the spread.

3. about the shower: there's less risk from using the same shower as the bacteria/virus cannot survive long outside the human body. however, it would be safer if you clean the shower with disinfectant before use. 

4. masks: masks are generally effective for diseases that are airborne (spread in the air). since mono is typically spread through saliva, a mask might not be necessary but wearing one, especially when in close contact, could help provide a physical barrier to potential contact with infected bodily fluid. 

5. period of precautions: mono can be contagious for a long period, from weeks to months, even after symptoms have subsided. nonetheless, it is not as contagious as some infections, such as the common cold.

6. moving rooms: if you have the option to move into another room, this could be one way to minimize your risk of infection. 

apart from these, you should also focus on boosting your immune system to avoid infection, get plenty of rest, eat a healthy diet, exercise regularly, and drink plenty of fluids. 

however, remember that this advice is not a substitute for professional medical advice. it's best to consult with a healthcare provider to better understand how to protect yourself."
N42,response_5,"""kissing disease"" is typically a nickname for infectious mononucleosis, also known as mono, which is most commonly caused by the epstein-barr virus (ebv). it's commonly spread through saliva (hence it's nickname), but it can also be spread through other bodily fluids like tears, mucus from the upper respiratory tract, as well as through the sharing of utensils, straws, or toothbrushes. 

1. can we use the same shower (at different times)? yes, you can use the same shower at different times. mono is not believed to be spread by contact with objects or surfaces, including water droplets in a shower. the virus might not survive long outside the body so the risk of contracting it from a shared shower should be low.

2. should they wear a mask in and out of the room? wearing a mask could help reduce the risk of spreading the virus but considering the main method of transmission is through saliva, this might not be as effective. 

3. how long do we have to take these precautions? mono symptoms usually show within four to six weeks after you get infected and may last for weeks or months. after symptoms go away, the virus remains dormant in your body but can reactivate occasionally. however, reactivation usually causes no symptoms.

4. should i just try to move into a new room? moving into a new room might be a good option especially if this is causing significant stress. you also mentioned about getting sick from your roommate before which might justify this further. 

5. other precautions: avoiding sharing items like glasses, dishes, and utensils that come in contact with saliva. wash your hands regularly and avoid getting too close to your roommate e.g. hugging, kissing.

remember, it's always best to consult a healthcare provider for more personalized advice."
N42,response_6,"""kissing disease,"" also known as mononucleosis or ""mono,"" is caused by the epstein-barr virus (ebv). it's often spread through saliva and close personal contact, hence its nickname. here's what you can/can't do:

1. yes, you can use the same shower (at different times). the virus does not survive well outside the body. hence, it's unlikely to be contracted from the environment, including surfaces like a shower floor or wall.

2. your roommate doesn't necessarily need to wear a mask around the room, but they should avoid sharing utensils, glasses, toothbrushes, etc., and should refrain from kissing others. they should also follow good hygiene practices, like covering the mouth and nose while coughing/sneezing, and washing hands frequently.

3. you, as the non-infected person, do not need to wear a mask either. but, again: good hygiene practices are key.

4. mono can be infectious for a period of a few weeks up to several months. so these precautions should be taken until your roommate has been cleared by a medical professional. 

5. whether you choose to move into a new room is entirely up to you. if you feel uncomfortable or worry about getting sick, then moving might be a good option.

6. unfortunately, if you've had close contact with your roommate while they might have been infectious, exposure to the virus may have already occurred. the symptoms typically appear 4 to 6 weeks after you're infected.

remember, everyone's immune system responds differently to the virus. while some people may have severe symptoms, others may have none at all. 

reach out to your health care provider or your local health center on campus for more guidance and to discuss your options if you suspect symptoms. 

take care of your own health first: eat a balanced diet, get plenty of rest, stay hydrated, avoid stress, and maintain good hygiene practices.

note: it's always best to get professional medical advice in situations like this."
N42,response_7,"first, ""kissing disease"" is commonly referred to as mononucleosis, or mono, which is a viral infection caused by the epstein-barr virus (ebv). mono is spread through bodily fluids, commonly through saliva, hence the term ""kissing disease."" it can also be spread through sharing utensils, sharing a drink, and coughing or sneezing if you're in close proximity. this being said, here are some advice:

1. you can use the same shower as your roommate, but do so with caution as the virus can technically survive outside of the body for several hours. don’t share towels or anything that may directly come to your mouth or face. it's better to clean shared bathrooms frequently.

2. it may not be necessary for your roommate to wear a mask all the time, especially when they are inside the room, but they should do so when they are coughing or sneezing to prevent droplets from spreading. same applies for you, within close proximity.

3. the precautions should be taken until your roommate no longer has symptoms and has been cleared by a doctor. this can be anywhere from weeks to months as mono has a long persistence.

4. if the living situation is overwhelmingly uncomfortable and unsafe for your health, moving to a new room could be a good alternative. to give you perspective, if you get mono, you may have prolonged fatigue and other symptoms that could affect your quality of life.

5. ensure a good immune system by eating well, maintaining good hygiene, and having enough rest. this will help you to reduce the chance of getting infected.

6. try to express your concerns to your roommate about their activities.

remember, while it's reasonable to take precautions, there's no need to go to extremes. mono is not as contagious as some infections, such as the common cold.
always remember, consulting a healthcare professional regarding these concerns would provide a more precise and relevant advice based on your health situation."

here are some general guidelines:

1. you can use the same shower, but try not to use your roommate's personal items such as towels, toothbrushes, or utensils. mono doesn't spread through water droplets in the air, but if your roommate coughs on you, there's a small risk of transmission.

2. your roommate doesn't need to wear a mask, and neither do you, unless he's coughing or sneezing a lot. even then, the virus is not typically spread through cough or sneeze droplets.

3. you'll need to continue these precautions for as long as your roommate is sick, and potentially for a bit longer. symptoms usually last for 2 to 4 weeks, but fatigue can last for several weeks or even months after other symptoms have subsided.

4. whether you should move rooms is up to you. it may be difficult to get mono from just living with someone, but it's not impossible. if it's an option and you're worried about catching the virus, moving might make sense.

5. if you do get sick frequently, it might be worth talking to a doctor or nurse about ways you could potentially boost your wellness or immunity.

please remember this advice is general in nature, and you should reach out to a healthcare professional for advice tailored to your specific situation. they can give you the best tips to avoid getting mononucleosis and manage the situation."
N42,response_9,"firstly, it's important to remember that mono, also known as mononucleosis or ""the kissing disease,"" is not something to panic about. it is a common illness, caused by the epstein-barr virus (ebv), and most people are exposed to it at some point in their lives. the virus spreads through saliva, hence the nickname ""kissing disease"", but can also spread through coughs, sneezes, or by sharing a drink or utensils with a person who has the virus.

that being said, here are answers to your questions:

1. sharing a shower is fine. mono does not spread through water droplets on hard surfaces, so you can continue to use the same shower (at different times), toilet, and sinks.

2. you or your roommate do not necessarily need to wear masks, since mono is not airborne like covid-19. the primary mode of transmission is through direct contact with an infected person's saliva.

3. the virus can last in the body for a few weeks to several months. it is typically most contagious during the first 2-4 weeks of the symptoms.

4. whether you should move to a new room or not largely depends on how comfortable you feel about the situation. if it's causing significant stress or impacting your life in a negative way, it might be worth considering.

to prevent yourself from getting sick, practice basic hygiene measures:

- avoid close contact with your roommate like kissing, sharing utensils, toothbrushes, or drinking glasses.
- wash your hands frequently with soap and warm water, or use a hands sanitizer if soap and water are not available.
- avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
- keep your surroundings clean. regularly clean common surfaces such as counters, doorknobs, and bathroom fixtures.

if you feel sick or notice any symptoms such as fatigue, fever, sore throat, swollen lymph nodes, and headache, it's wise to get checked.

remember: your health and well-being come first. if your roommate's actions are affecting you negatively, it might be worth to have a direct conversation about it or discuss it with a housing supervisor."

you can use the same shower at different times. mono is not known to be transmitted through water droplets.

it is important both you and your roommate maintain good hygiene, wash hands frequently, avoid sharing drinks, food, or eating utensils. 

wearing a mask could help, particularly if your roommate frequently coughs or sneezes. 

the virus can remain in the body for a few months even after symptoms have subsided so continued precaution is useful. 

about moving into a new room: if possible, this would be the best option to completely avoid exposure. 

try to communicate your concerns to your roommate. it's important that the person who is sick takes responsibility for not spreading the virus.

N42,response_11,"kissing disease, or mononucleosis (mono), is most commonly caused by the epstein-barr virus, which spreads through saliva. it's often spread by sharing eating utensils, such as glasses or food, and by kissing, hence its informal name. it's less likely to be spread through droplets in the air from coughing or sneezing, unlike certain other infections like a cold or the flu.

yes, you can use the same shower but at different times. make sure that the bathroom is clean and preferably, don't share towels, soap, or any other personal hygiene items.

your roommate might want to wear a mask when he or she is sick to prevent the spreading of the virus. the same goes for you, it's safer to take precautions. 

the length of time you need to take precautions will depend on how long your roommate is contagious, which can vary. they would generally no longer be contagious once their symptoms have resolved. it's recommended to discuss this with a medical professional to get a better understanding.

about moving into a new room, that also depends on your individual circumstances.

prevention is better than cure. therefore, try to avoid close contact with your roommate, don't share utensils, food or drinks, and maintain good hygiene, especially washing your hands frequently.

remember that the incubation period (the time between when you get the virus and when symptoms start) for mono can be quite long - about 4 to 6 weeks. this could mean you could be exposed without knowing it quite some time ago. so, even if you limit contact with your roommate now, there's still a chance you could get sick.

it's also helpful to speak to a doctor or a nurse about these worries. they could have other practical suggestions. also, consider having a frank conversation with your roommate about your concerns."

1. using the same shower should not be an issue as mono is not usually spread through water droplets. the virus does not survive outside the body for very long, so it is unlikely you can get it this way.

2. wearing a mask can help prevent the spread, but is not always practical in a living situation. your roommate should definitely avoid coughing or sneezing without covering their mouth and nose, and avoid sharing items that come into contact with the mouth. 

3. the virus can be contagious for a period of time before symptoms appear and for some time after the person feels better. it can vary from person to person, but the contagious period could be several weeks.

4. you could certainly consider requesting a new room if it's causing discomfort. however, the risk of getting mono from casual contact is relatively low.

5. try to maintain good hygiene, such as washing hands regularly, not sharing personal items like toothbrushes, glasses, and utensils, and avoid close contact as much as possible.

6. if you start to notice symptoms like extreme fatigue, fever, sore throat, head and body aches, swollen lymph nodes in the neck and armpits, swollen liver or spleen or rash; consult a doctor right away.

always remember, the precaution one should take depends on the individual's health, comfort level, and personal boundaries. it's crucial to maintain open communication with your roommate during this time.

N42,response_13,"kissing disease, also known as mononucleosis or mono, is a viral infection often associated with symptoms like fever, sore throat, swollen lymph glands, and fatigue. it's usually caused by the epstein-barr virus (ebv). it's true that the virus is spread through saliva, so there's potential for transmission through shared utensils, toothbrushes, or other objects, as well as through kissing, of course.

here's what you should do to minimize your risk of infection:

1. don't share eating utensils, toothbrushes, or glasses with your roommate.
2. try to avoid direct contact with their saliva. don't kiss them or share food or drinks.
3. wash your hands frequently and especially after any possible contact.
4. clean shared spaces regularly, especially areas that your roommate touches a lot -- like doorknobs or remote controls.

it's also possible to contract mono from airborne droplets. however, the risk is comparatively low. using a shared shower should be fine, as the virus is not known to survive well outside the body for very long, especially on hard surfaces. 

your roommate wearing a mask may help to some extent, but it might not be very practical. 

in terms of duration, unfortunately, people with mono can remain contagious for months, even after symptoms have cleared up.

moving to another room might be a good idea if it's feasible for you, just to minimize the risks further, especially given your concerns and past experiences. 

in any case, remember that while avoiding mono is preferable, it's not usually a severe illness for people your age. most people recover completely within two to four weeks, although fatigue can linger for several weeks or even months in some cases.

finally, bear in mind that not every exposure to the virus results in illness. it's estimated that many people contract ebv during their childhood, have no or mild symptoms, and then have lifelong immunity - they effectively become carriers of the virus but are not contagious and won't get sick from it.

1. **separate items:** you can use the same shower at different times, but try to avoid sharing eatables, beverages, utensils, toothbrushes, or any item that may have been in contact with their saliva.

2. **hygiene:** good personal hygiene will greatly reduce your risk of contracting the disease. frequently wash your hands, especially before eating and after using the bathroom.

3. **masks:** wearing masks around each other could potentially provide extra protection but isn't typically recommended for mono because it's most often spread by direct contact with infected saliva, not by airborne droplets.

4. **duration:** mono can last anywhere from a few weeks to several months. it may take 4 to 6 weeks for symptoms to appear after you've been exposed to the virus. your roommate should be considered contagious as long as they are experiencing symptoms, and sometimes slightly beyond.

5. **moving rooms:** if it's an option for you, moving into a separate room could be one of the best ways to avoid contracting the virus.

6. **rest and medical advice:** if you start to show symptoms (like fatigue, fever, sore throat), immediately seek medical advice. rest, hydration, and over-the-counter remedies for fever and pain are generally the main elements of treatment.

N42,response_16,"mononucleosis, often referred to as the ""kissing disease,"" is generally spread through saliva, thus the name. you are right though, it can also spread through respiratory droplets. here are answers to your queries:

1. using the same shower: you should be okay to use the same shower as long as you're not using it at the same time and you're not sharing towels or washcloths. mono isn't contracted through the skin, but through the mucus membranes in your mouth and nose.

2. wearing a mask: you're unlikely to catch mono through the air as it's primarily spread via direct contact with saliva, not by sharing breathing space. however, if your roommate sneezes or coughs without covering their mouth, droplets can contain the virus. wearing a mask could add some protection, but it's not a guarantee.

3. precaution duration: symptoms of mono can last for one to two months, but the virus can remain in your saliva for months after the symptoms have ended. this means that your roommate can still pass it on to you even if they're feeling better.

4. moving to a new room: this may be a drastic solution but it can certainly reduce your chances of getting sick. 

5. dealing with roommate: have a conversation with your roommate about cleanliness and hygiene, especially when they are sick. it's vital they understand the importance of their actions to reduce chances of spreading illnesses.

preventing the spread of mono is best done by avoiding close contact, like kissing or sharing drink containers. the virus can also live for several hours in saliva that's outside the body, so avoid sharing things like toothbrushes or eating utensils. 

keep in mind, while it is understandable that you want to avoid getting sick, a large proportion of people have been exposed to mono by adulthood and it doesn't always develop into illness. make sure to rest, maintain good nutrition, and manage stress - these will all help your immune system fight off potential infections.

2. maintain good hygiene habits. this includes frequent hand washing and disinfecting shared areas, such as doorknobs and light switches.
3. keep your personal space as clean as possible.

showering separately should be fine, as long as you're not sharing towels or other personal items. the risk of catching mononucleosis from water droplets in a shower is very low.

in regards to wearing masks, it would be beneficial if your roommate is in close proximity with you and is coughing or sneezing. this could potentially reduce the risk of transmission. you might want to consider wearing one yourself as an extra precaution.

the duration of precautions could vary. it's difficult to say how long your roommate will be contagious, but period of highest risk is probably during the early stages of illness. however, the epstein-barr virus can still be present in saliva for months after symptoms have resolved.

moving into a new room might be something to consider if the living situation is causing you stress or if you keep getting sick. it's important to prioritize your own health and well-being.

lastly, communicate with your roommate about your concerns and try to establish some ground rules to keep both of you healthy. if he's not willing to take steps to protect your health, it might be best to separate living situations. you might also consider discussing the situation with your housing provider and see what solutions they can offer. 

always remember to seek professional medical advice regarding these types of situations. the above suggestions are based on what is generally recommended but may not be applicable to every situation."
N42,response_22,"i'm not a doctor, but here are some general tips in dealing with a roommate who has mononucleosis, more commonly known as the kissing disease. mono is caused by the epstein-barr virus and it is indeed spread through saliva and mucus, typically via kissing, sharing drinks or utensils, or being exposed to coughs or sneezes.

1. shared shower: as long as you’re using the shower at different times and you’re not sharing towels, this should be fine. make sure the bathroom is cleaned regularly. 

2. wearing masks: wearing face masks could help prevent the transmission of mono as well as other illnesses. your roommate who is sick should definitely consider wearing one if they're coughing and sneezing often. as the person not sick, wearing a mask couldn't hurt, but it may not be completely necessary if your roommate is careful. 

3. duration of precautions: the infectious period for mono can vary, but symptoms usually appear 4 to 6 weeks after you get infected. even if symptoms disappear, you can still carry the virus in your mouth for up to 18 months. it doesn't necessarily mean you're infectious during this whole time, but it's still good to maintain good hygiene practices.

4. moving to a new room: this might be the best course of action for your situation, especially if this is not the first time you've gotten sick from your roommate's habits. this would reduce your potential exposure to the virus and give you peace of mind.

5. additional precautions: try not to share drinks, utensils, toothbrushes, or any other item that may come in contact with your roommate's saliva. wash your hands regularly.

6. seek medical advice: always reach out to a healthcare professional about specific actions/recommendations for your situation.

remember though, while it's good to take precautions, there's no certain way to prevent getting mono if you're living close to someone who currently has it. but, maintaining good hygiene practices can definitely lower your risk."
N42,response_23,"mononucleosis (the ""kissing disease"") is spread through bodily fluids and can be contagious for weeks or months after symptoms have subsided. it's primarily spread through saliva but can also be spread through a sneeze or cough, or by sharing drinks or food. transmission through water droplets in a shared shower is less likely, but still possible. your concerns are valid, and there are several steps you can take to reduce your risk.

1. **hygiene:** maintain excellent hygiene. this includes frequent hand washing, not sharing personal items (e.g., dishes, utensils, towels), and thoroughly cleaning shared spaces (like the shower) between uses.

2. **mask usage:** if you don't have access to a separate bathroom, having your roommate wear a mask in shared areas, particularly when they're showing symptoms or are known to be contagious, can help reduce the risk of spreading the disease. you should also consider wearing a mask in these instances.

3. **social distancing:** limit your close contact with your roommate as much as possible, especially during acute stages of their illness.

4. **duration of precautions:** your roommate should no longer be contagious about a couple of months after symptoms subside. however, because everyone's body is different, it can take longer. you might want to continue taking precautions until your housing contract ends.

5. **consider moving:** if your roommate continues demonstrating risky behavior, you should certainly consider moving to a new room or other accommodation, if possible.

you should have a honest conversation with your roommate about your concerns. if you express your worries and anxiety, hopefully they'll be understanding and willing to adjust their behavior, or make it easier for you to adapt to the situation.

finally, keep in mind that everyone's immune system is different. while your roommate may have caught mono, that doesn't guarantee you will too, even if you're in close proximity to them. some people are simply more prone to catching infectious diseases. 

always stay in touch with your healthcare provider for personal medical advice."
N42,response_24,"infectious mononucleosis, which is sometimes known as kissing disease, is caused by the epstein barr virus. it is mainly spread by saliva and close contact. this is why it has come to be referred to as the 'kissing disease'. it can be spread through coughing, sneezing, or by sharing a glass or food utensils with someone who has mono. it is unlikely to be spread through shared showers or toilets.

if your roommate has been diagnosed with mono, here are some things you can do:

1. do not share items that can spread the infection. this includes things like drinking glasses, toothbrushes, or eating utensils.

2. maintain good hygiene. wash your hands regularly and use hand sanitizer if soap and water isn't available. 

3. you can use the same shower at different times. the virus doesn't survive long outside the body, and it would be highly unlikely to catch the virus this way.

4. it is probably not necessary for them to wear a mask, but it might be a good idea if they are frequently coughing or sneezing, especially in shared spaces.

5. usually, a person can spread the virus for a few weeks, but sometimes it can be for longer. follow these precautions until your roommate has no symptoms at all.

6. chance of getting infected is relatively low unless you share saliva or have close contact, so a new room may not be necessary unless you guys often share utensils, drinks etc. you might need to reconsider this if you are very concerned about the chance of getting sick.

remember, even though it may be frustrating to get sick because of your roommate's lifestyle choices, infectious illnesses like mono can happen to anyone at any time. it's not specifically because they party or stay up late. they probably caught the virus from someone else who had it. it's always a good idea to practice good hygiene and health habits to avoid getting sick.

be patient with your roommate as mono can make a person feel really unwell and tired. it may be a good opportunity to have a constructive talk about your concerns around shared health and wellness in your living situation."
N42,response_25,"the ""kissing disease,"" or mononucleosis, is majorly spread through saliva and close contact. activities such as kissing, sharing dishes, and eating utensils, can increase your risk of contracting the virus. however, it's not typically not as contagious as some infections, such as the common cold.

1. using the same shower: considering that mono is not generally spread through water droplets, using the same shower should be fine. however, maintain good hygiene practices like not sharing personal items such as face towels, washcloths, toothbrushes, etc. 

2. wearing a mask: ideally, both of you could consider wearing a mask indoors if the person is coughing or sneezing. this will particularly help in preventing other infectious diseases that may be spread through such methods.

3. precautions duration: as far as the duration goes, it's recommended to continue these precautions till your roommate is symptom-free. mono can sometimes last for a few weeks to a few months. 

4. moving to a new room: if you are able to move to another room, it may be a safer option to prevent catching the disease. however, if moving isn't possible, practicing good hygiene and avoiding close contact should largely reduce the risk of transmission.

5. concerns about your roommate's lifestyle: if your roommate's actions are affecting your health regularly, you might want to discuss this issue with him/her, or raise a complaint with your housing admin, to see if there could be some resolution.

remember to wash your hands regularly and avoid touching your face as much as possible. boost your immune system by eating healthily, sleeping well, and regularly exercising. if you feel any symptoms (like fatigue, fever, sore throat, swollen lymph nodes in the neck, etc.) contact your healthcare professional immediately. 
   
keep in mind this advice is general in nature and not as specific as a one-on-one consultation with a doctor. consider seeking professional medical advice if you have any further concerns."
