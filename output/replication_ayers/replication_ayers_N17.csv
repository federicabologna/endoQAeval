N17,response_1,"based on the photos and your description, it's most likely that the bump under your arm is an enlarged lymph node, also known as lymphadenitis. it's common for lymph nodes to enlarge and become tender when your body is combating infection. that being said, the infections can range from a simple skin infection to more serious conditions like stds including hiv. 

your symptoms are non specific and cannot definitely conclude that you have a std, however certain stds and hiv can cause enlarged lymph nodes. other symptoms of these diseases usually include unexplained weight loss, persistent fatigue, sore throat, night sweats, etc. 

while it could also be a result of other common conditions such as a skin infection, ingrown hair or a result of injury from shaving, your recent sexual activity and illness symptoms may warrant an std test to rule out any such conditions. 

therefore, i recommend that you schedule an appointment with your healthcare provider. they will be able to better assess your condition in the context of a full medical evaluation. it's important to know that these issues can be quite serious, but they're also treatable, especially when detected early. please seek medical advice and do not postpone."
N17,response_2,"it's important for me to clarify that i'm an ai model, and i can't make a diagnosis, especially based on a picture. however, it's worth noting that underarm lumps are frequently due to inflammation of the sweat glands or hair follicles, particularly if you've been working out and sweating more. it could also be caused by a bacterial or viral infection, a common cyst, or a lipoma, which is a harmless fatty lump. it seems less likely to be related to a sexually transmitted disease (std) or hiv, which typically don't cause underarm lumps. 

however, given the symptoms you've described, it would be a good idea to get this lump checked out by a healthcare provider. they may also check your other lymph nodes to see if they're swollen which could indicate an infection or other medical condition. if you're concerned about recent sexual activity, it never hurts to request an std screening for peace of mind.

don't be overly concerned, but do make an appointment to see your healthcare provider soon. remember don't try to pierce or squeeze the lump, particularly if it's painful. continue to monitor the lump, particularly for changes in size, shape, colour, or if it begins to drain fluid."
N17,response_3,"the symptoms you describe sound like they may be due to a swollen lymph node or a bacterial infection such as folliculitis, both of which can be due to many causes and are not necessarily related to a sexually transmitted disease.

your lymph nodes, an important part of your immune system, can become enlarged or painful due to an infection, injury, or more rarely, a type of cancer. folliculitis, a type of skin infection, occurs when hair follicles become inflamed because of damage or bacterial infection, and can happen anywhere there is hair on your body, including your armpits. symptoms can include a small red or white-headed bump around a hair follicle, tender, swollen skin, soreness or itching, and pus-filled blisters.

while it's not impossible for these symptoms to be related to a sexually transmitted disease, it is less likely, particularly given the location, and it would not be a typical symptom of hiv.

however, given your recent sexual activity, it would be a good idea to get a std test to rule out any potential infections.

if the underarm bump stays the same, gets larger, or more painful, or if other symptoms appear, it would be best to see a healthcare professional - their examination and any necessary tests can help to properly diagnose and treat the issue."
N17,response_4,"the picture and symptoms you've described sound more consistent with an infected hair follicle, cyst, abscess or lymph node â€” these can be common in the underarm area due to the presence of hair follicles and sweat glands. it doesn't sound typical of an sexually transmitted disease (std) or symptom of hiv. 

however, only a professional examination can properly diagnose what is causing your symptoms. please do not delay seeking medical attention, as infections can worsen or spread if untreated. consult with your healthcare provider as soon as physically possible.

regarding your sexual health concerns, routine std testing is a good practice if you are sexually active, especially with new or multiple partners. this can help catch many infections earlier, when they can be better managed or treated.

remember that online advice is not a substitute for professional medical advice."
N17,response_5,"i am an artificial intelligence, and while i can give some general advice on the subject, i cannot diagnose a condition based on images or descriptions. 

however, i can tell you that underarm bumps are often not related to sexually transmitted diseases. they're usually connected with other things like ingrown hairs, a wart, a cyst, or a reaction to antiperspirants. they can also result from a blocked sweat gland or a swollen lymph node, which could occur due to a mild infection somewhere else in your body. the other symptoms like fever might suggest that you're fighting some kind of infection.

hiv generally does not cause symptoms like this, particularly so soon after a possible exposure. early hiv symptoms, when they occur, are usually more vague and flu-like, and swollen lymph nodes due to hiv usually occur all over the body, not just at one site.

nevertheless, from your history, it's still important for you to understand that unprotected oral sex does carry a small risk of stds including gonorrhea, syphilis, and herpes.

it's definitely a good idea to get a std test if you are sexually active with multiple partners or practice unprotected sex. you should also see a healthcare professional about this underarm lump; they can examine you and give you an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment.

please do not rely solely on internet and ai advice when you are feeling unwell. it's always best to seek help from a healthcare professional."
N17,response_6,"i'm an ai developed by openai, and while i can provide some general advice, the limits of my programming prevent me from providing an accurate diagnosis. based on the symptoms you've described, it sounds like you could potentially have an infected hair follicle, a condition known as folliculitis, or a swelling of the lymph nodes, which can occur due to various infections. both conditions might cause underarm discomfort and a slightly raised temperature.

stds generally don't cause symptoms like the one you're describing. while it's not typical, hiv can cause swollen lymph nodes, but this usually occurs along with other symptoms like fever, fatigue, and night sweats lasting for several weeks.

although your bump may not be directly related to recent sexual activity, given your concerns, it would be a good idea to have std screening for your own peace of mind.

remember, it's crucial to see a healthcare provider in person to get an accurate diagnosis and the right treatment for your condition. you should seek medical attention soon since it's causing you pain and concern."
N17,response_7,"from the information and photos provided, it seems likelier that the lump you're experiencing is a result of a blocked sweat or sebaceous gland, which can be common in areas of the body with more sweat glands and hair follicles such as the underarm. these are often associated with redness, tenderness, and discomfort.

being sexually active can increase your possible exposure to stds including hiv, but the lump on the underarm is not a common symptom related to these conditions. however, persistent fevers, swelling lymph nodes, rash, or fatigue lasting more than a week may indicate the need for testing if associated with risky sexual behavior.

the fact that you also experienced a fever today (even if it has now subsided) could suggest an infection, which may or may not be related to the lump in your underarm.

however, it's not possible for me to give you a definitive diagnosis based on this information alone. it's important to see your healthcare provider promptly, as they can better assess your symptoms and make a proper diagnosis. remember to share any additional relevant details about your health condition and sexual activity.

in the meantime, watch for changes in the lump. if it increases in size, becomes even more painful, or is associated with more systemic symptoms like persistent fever, it is recommended to seek medical care sooner. you should also communicate changes in your overall health and possible exposure risks."
N17,response_8,"i'm an ai language model and can't look at pictures, but can provide some information based on your description. 

an underarm lump could have several causes. it could be an enlarged lymph node due to a nearby infection (for example, in your skin), caused by an underlying systemic illness, or due to other benign conditions such as a lipoma. 

given that you've been sexually active recently, there's no harm in getting an std panel for peace of mind, but it's unlikely an underarm lump alone would be a sign of an std. 

it's also unlikely to be a sign of hiv - most common symptoms of recent hiv infection (when they do occur) include fever, fatigue, rash, sore throat and swollen lymph nodes, usually in the neck and groin rather than underarm.

however, any new lump should be evaluated by a healthcare professional, especially if it is causing discomfort and associated with fever. they may recommend further tests such as ultrasound or biopsy, depending on the firmness, mobility, and other characteristics of the lump.

please consult with a healthcare provider as soon as possible to rule out any serious conditions."
N17,response_9,"i'm an ai developed by openai and i'm not a doctor, but i can suggest that your symptoms could be related to several things that are milder than some sexually transmitted diseases (stds) or hiv. it can often be a blocked sweat gland or infected hair follicle, especially if you've noticed it after sweating or working out. 

these symptoms might be indicative of a common health issue like a skin infection or cyst, among other things. sometimes, the body can react to a small infection anywhere in the skin with a fever and fatigue.

it's still a good idea to reach out to a healthcare professional who can take a closer look at your symptoms, especially because you're concerned about your sexual health. they can provide a more accurate diagnosis based on your symptoms and history and guide you on the right path. 

if you're concerned about stds, discussing with a healthcare provider about the need for testing would be recommended.

again, i'm an ai, so interpretations made by me should not replace advice from a healthcare professional."
N17,response_10,"i'm an ai model, not a doctor, but from the description you've given, this could be an enlarged lymph node which can become swollen due to various causes, including infection, injury, or in rare cases, cancer. note that a range of stds can cause swollen lymph nodes, including syphilis, gonorrhea, herpes, and hiv. but swollen lymph nodes in the armpit are also commonly caused by non-std related infections or conditions, including bacterial or viral infections, or even from excessive sweating or shaving. to get a definitive diagnosis and advice on treatment it's important to visit a healthcare professional. since you've been sexually active and didn't use barrier protection for oral sex, getting tested for stds could be good for peace of mind. but remember, this advice is provided by an ai and it's always better to consult a doctor immediately in person."
N17,response_11,"i'm an ai language model, and while i can't diagnose a condition, i can give you some potential causes. the bump you've noticed under your arm could possibly be an infected hair follicle, a sweat gland infection (known as hidradenitis), a swollen lymph node, or potentially something else entirely. the swelling and pain you're experiencing might be a result of inflammation and infection.

your fever and fatigue can be symptoms of many different conditions, including a simple infection that your body is fighting off. they do not necessarily indicate a sexually transmitted disease (std).

furthermore, stds and hiv typically do not present with underarm lumps as a primary symptom. however, swollen lymph nodes could be a sign of a systemic infection, which can be related to various medical conditions, including some stds.

it's important to remember that hiv or othe stds would not present symptoms only a week after potential exposure. symptoms usually surface after a few weeks to a few months.

while i'm giving some potential causes, i'd strongly advise you to consult a healthcare professional. they will be able to evaluate your symptoms more accurately and provide appropriate tests if necessary, such as an std screening, a blood count, or an ultrasound of the lump if necessary.

in the meantime, don't panic. a lump in the underarm is a relatively common occurrence and is often related to relatively benign conditions. but do get it checked out for peace of mind and appropriate treatment if needed."
N17,response_12,"i'm an ai language model and i'm not a doctor, but i can give some general insights. the underarm bump you've got could be due to a variety of reasons, from a simple skin infection to a swollen lymph node.

stds typically don't present with underarm bumps, although lymph nodes can swell as part of some stds, such as hiv. however, this is often accompanied by more significant symptoms such as weight loss, night sweats, or general malaise.

a simple, more typical cause of an underarm bump could be a blocked hair follicle or sweat gland leading to a boil or an abscess, both of which can make you feel a bit unwell.

as for your fatigue and fever, it's hard to determine without a full medical examination whether these symptoms are related to your underarm bump, or they are coincidental and caused by another condition, such as a viral infection.

if the bump persists or worsens, or if you are concerned about your recent sexual activity, it would be a good idea to visit a healthcare provider. they can rule out anything serious and guide you on the next steps. you could also consider getting an std test for peace of mind.

always remember, practicing safe sex, including during oral sex, is essential in preventing stds."
N17,response_13,"i'm an ai language model and not a doctor, but i can tell you that a lump in the underarm could represent a variety of health conditions, such as a cyst, an infected hair follicle, a sweat gland infection (a condition called hidradenitis suppurativa), or swollen lymph nodes. 

swollen lymph nodes in the armpit can be due to local infections, systemic viral infections, or systemic conditions that trigger immunity (like an autoimmune disease or certain malignancies). 

this lump does not immediately suggest a sexually transmitted infection (sti) or hiv. typically, stis manifest as genital or oral symptoms, not as underarm lumps. however, hiv can cause generalized swollen lymph nodes. 

if you've had unprotected sex recently, it would be good to get tested for stis including hiv for peace of mind, and because early detection and treatment can potentially prevent serious complications. 

also, any new, painful lump warrants evaluation by a healthcare provider. particularly since you've also been feeling feverish and fatigued, it's important to have this checked out. these could be signs of an infection or other systemic condition that needs prompt attention. 

in any case, please seek an actual medical opinion from a healthcare professional. this information is not to replace them and only aims to provide general information for you."
N17,response_14,"to answer your questions directly, the chances of your underarm bump being an std or a symptom of hiv is highly unlikely. stds and hiv usually present with different symptoms.

based on the description and given the location, it sounds like you may have an ingrown hair or an inflamed lymph node (could be due to an infection elsewhere in the body), or a possible skin infection like folliculitis or a furuncle. 

regarding the other symptoms: fever and fatigue can be associated with an infection. 

while a physical examination is necessary for a more accurate diagnosis, from your description, there seems to be no immediate cause for panic. 

continue to monitor for any changes, if the lump grows in size, becomes more painful, you develop other symptoms, or it doesn't get better in a couple of weeks, you should consult a healthcare provider. 

about testing for stds & hiv: you mentioned that you've been sexually active, it would be good for your peace of mind to get tested even if this symptom is not related. in future, consider using protection in all sexual activities, including oral sex, to reduce the risk of stds/hiv."
N17,response_15,"from the information and the images you've provided, the symptoms you're experiencing (a bump/lymph node under your arm that's a bit painful and slight fever) most likely suggest an infection or inflammation in your body. this could be due to several reasons, not necessarily sexually transmitted infections (stis) or hiv. 

stis such as syphilis or herpes could theoretically cause swollen lymph nodes, but this is usually associated with other more characteristic symptoms. hiv can indeed cause swollen lymph nodes, but this symptom alone is not enough to consider it likely. fatigue could be due to many reasons including overworking, stress, poor nutrition, or slight infection.

the underarm bump could also be due to skin conditions such as hidradenitis suppurativa, which is not related to sexual activity, but more due to blockage of sweat glands. in rare circumstances, it could be linked to more serious conditions like cancer, but this is unlikely at your age and with the presence of your other symptoms.

the key thing to do is to wait and watch for a few days. if the symptoms persist or if you develop other symptoms such as unexplained weight loss, night sweats, rash etc, then you should definitely reach out to a healthcare provider for evaluation. 

meanwhile, drink plenty of fluids, eat nutritious food, get ample rest, maintain good hygiene and continue to monitor your body. 

safe sex practices are always encouraged regardless of these symptoms to prevent stds, therefore your mention of recent sexual activity should be a reminder that regular screening for stds is a good idea, especially after any unprotected sex. 

and always, if you are worried, please don't hesitate to reach out to a healthcare professional who can give you more specific advice based on a physical examination. this should not replace a medical consultation."
N17,response_16,"i'm an ai language model, not a doctor, however, i can tell you that the bump under your arm could be a number of things. it could be a swollen lymph node, which can happen when your body is fighting an infection or disease. it could also be a sebaceous cyst, a sweat gland infection, or a result of physical irritation from clothing or shaving. normally, an std would cause symptoms in the genital area, but some, like syphilis, can cause symptoms elsewhere on the body.

to determine the cause, you should consult a healthcare professional. they can obtain a thorough history, examine the bump, and decide if further tests like blood tests or imaging are necessary. if you've had unprotected sex, it's a good idea to get an std panel test to rule out sexually transmitted infections. if you're worried about possible hiv exposure, keep in mind that it can take 2-6 weeks for symptoms to appear, and they manifest as flu-like symptoms which can include fever, sore throat, rash, and swollen lymph nodes all over the body, not just in one location.

remember this is only advice and cannot replace a proper medical consultation. sudden swelling, pain, fever, and fatigue are signs that you should speak with a healthcare professional."
N17,response_17,"i'm an ai language model developed by openai, and although i don't have the ability to view your photo or exam you in person, i can provide some general insights. 

swollen lymph nodes in the axillary (underarm) region can be caused by a number of things, including infections and immune response to a variety of conditions. it is less likely that it's directly related to a sexually transmitted disease (std), particularly if you have no other signs or symptoms of stds such as genital sores, blisters, discharge, or unusual pain. 

while rare, in some cases, swollen lymph nodes can be a sign of more serious illnesses, like certain types of cancer or systemic infections. generalized swollem lymph nodes can sometimes be a symptom of hiv, but it would usually present with other symptoms and not just one isolated node.

an isolated node is more likely due to localized infection or bacteria that was trapped in the lymph node.
 
given your recent unwell feeling and the newly noticed underarm bump, you should definitely consult with a healthcare provider. they may ask you to monitor it for any changes or they may decide to investigate it further. it's good that you noticed this change in your body. please make sure to communicate all of your symptoms and concerns to your healthcare provider. 

as always, regular std testing is recommended for sexually active individuals for maintenance of sexual health. please remember to always use protection during sexual encounters to decrease the risk of contracting or spreading stds. 

please note though that while i can provide general advice and insight, i do not replace the personalized advice and diagnosis that a healthcare professional can give."
N17,response_18,"i am an ai, and i can't look at pictures or examine you personally. however, based on your description, it sounds more like a swollen lymph node or a skin infection such as folliculitis rather than an std. fatigue, fever, and swollen lymph nodes are usual signs that your body is fighting an infection. this could be due to a variety of reasons, including a reaction to a minor skin infection or even an allergic reaction. 

while it's important to note that a few stds or hiv may sometimes cause swollen lymph nodes, other symptoms usually accompany them. 

i would recommend you to visit a healthcare provider for a proper evaluation. there's no need to immediately worry about serious illnesses. however, if you've had recent unprotected sex and you're concerned about stds, it would be a good idea to request the relevant tests for peace of mind. regular std testing is also recommended if you're sexually active with multiple partners."
N17,response_19,"i'm an ai language model and can't see the image you're talking about. however, when you provide a description, it could possibly be an inflamed lymph node or an infected sweat gland or hair follicle, especially if you've been shaving your armpit. inflamed lymph nodes in the armpit often result from an infection or injury in the hand or arm. though rarely, they can also be a sign of immune disorders or cancer.

as for your concern about sexually transmitted diseases or hiv, most stds don't usually cause symptoms like underarm lumps. but if you're at risk of having an std due to unprotected sex, you should discuss with your healthcare provider about testing.

initial flu-like symptoms can occur in the early acute phase of hiv, which may resemble other viral illnesses. these symptoms often go away within a week to a month and are often mistaken for those of another viral infection. however, a lump under your arm is not typically a symptom of acute hiv. 

regardless, if the lump grows bigger, if it doesn't resolve within a few weeks, or if it becomes increasingly painful, you should seek medical attention. the same applies if you experience other symptoms such as night sweats, weight loss without trying, or fever that doesn't go away. also, any sexual concerns or risk factors for stds should be discussed with your healthcare provider, who may recommend appropriate tests, treatments, or preventative measures.

please remember that this advice is intended to be general in nature, and specific causes may not apply to your situation. always consult with a healthcare provider for accurate information."
N17,response_20,"without seeing the bump in person or having a lot more information, it's difficult to say exactly what it could be. however based on your description, several possibilities come to mind. bumps in the underarm area are often due to a swollen lymph node, which can be caused by a number of factors, including infection or injury. one possibility could be an infected hair follicle or sweat gland, especially if you've been exercising vigorously or sweating more than usual.

while some stds can cause swollen lymph nodes, they typically don't show up as a solitary bump in the underarm area. other symptoms you might see with an std could include a rash, sores, or discharge.

hiv could cause a swollen lymph node, but it also wouldn't typically show up as a solitary bump in the underarm area. other symptoms that might accompany an hiv infection could include fever, sore throat, and body aches.

if you are concerned, i would certainly advise you to see a healthcare professional for a more precise diagnosis. they may advise you to have an std test depending on your symptoms and recent sexual history. don't wait to get help if you're worried - it's always better to be safe and get a professional opinion."
N17,response_21,"without examine you medically, it's hard to provide a definitive diagnosis but it does look like you have an enlarged lymph node under your armpit which may suggest that your body is trying to fight off an infection. given your recent sexual activity, it could be an std, but it could also be the result of a variety of other infections, or due to a reaction to a potential injury or irritation to the skin in that area.

hiv can cause swollen lymph nodes, but it's usually not the only symptom. most people with the early stages of hiv also have fever, fatigue and a rash. if you feel that you might be at risk for hiv, it would be best to get tested.

here are next steps i suggest:
1. make an appointment to see your doctor as soon as possible.
2. avoid any sexual activity until you see your doctor.
3. if it persists and worsens, seek immediate medical care. 

please do not rely solely on this advice and seek real medical attention. this advice does not replace a trip to the doctor's office. only your doctor can provide a definitive diagnosis."
N17,response_22,"with the available information and pictures provided, this underarm bump seems to be consistent with an inflamed lymph node, or possibly an abscess or cyst. 

lymph nodes can become inflamed or enlarged due to various reasons including infections, diseases, or immune responses. the symptoms you're experiencing (fever, fatigue) could be due to your body fighting off an infection, hence the inflamed lymph node. recent sexual activity can potentially be a factor if the partner had an infection you were exposed to, but it is not necessarily indicative of a sexually transmitted disease. 

generally, it's important to note that symptoms of hiv are quite variable and may not present until years after exposure; however, an inflamed lymph node is a common symptom (though not specific to hiv). if you suspect or are anxious about hiv or any other std, it is always better to get tested for peace of mind.

given the circumstances, it would be a good idea to schedule an appointment with your primary care physician to have this lump properly evaluated and to discuss your symptoms and concerns in detail. they may refer you to a specialist or order some diagnostic tests or labs if necessary.

while this does not seem immediately life-threatening, it's important to have it checked out, especially if it doesn't resolve in a week or two, or if additional symptoms present. 

remember online advice is not a substitute for clinical evaluation and cannot provide a definitive diagnosis."
N17,response_23,"underarm bumps can be caused by many conditions such as swollen lymph nodes, cysts, abscess, or skin infection, etc. swollen lymph nodes under the arm can be caused by a number of conditions, including viral or bacterial infections, systemic diseases such as lupus or rheumatoid arthritis, certain medications, or cancers such as lymphoma or breast cancer. 

many sexually transmitted diseases (stds) like syphilis can sometimes cause swollen lymph nodes, but it's not common for them to appear in the armpits unless the infection site is nearby.

while it's unlikely this is an std or hiv just from the description and pictures, considering your recent unprotected sexual activity, it would be reasonable to get tested for stds just for your own peace of mind. it's also possible your body is simply fighting off a minor infection, which would explain the fever and fatigue.

still, it's important to monitor the lump and your other symptoms. if it persists, becomes red, tender, or starts draining, or if you start running a fever or feeling unwell, you should see a doctor without delay. 

in any case, given your symptoms and the presence of the lump, it would be good to see a healthcare provider to discuss the lump you found - they'll be able to provide the most accurate advice after examining you in person."
N17,response_24,"while an online platform can't replace a physical examination, it seems that your symptoms could potentially be related to an infected hair follicle, inflamed sweat gland (hidradenitis suppurativa), or swollen lymph node. swollen lymph nodes in the armpit can be due to a variety of causes, including infections, traumas, and in rare cases, cancer.

while unprotected oral sex can theoretically lead to some sexually transmitted diseases, it's unlikely that it caused the bump under your arm.

a persistent bump, particularly if it continues to be painful or gets larger, should be evaluated by a healthcare provider to find out exactly what it is, and how it should be treated.

hiv has a wide array of symptoms and can often cause flu-like symptoms including fever, fatigue, and swollen lymph nodes. however, based on just this bump under your arm, it's very difficult to say if this is due to hiv or not. if you're concerned about hiv or any other stds, getting tested would be a good idea to put your worries at ease or to begin treatment if necessary.

it's always better to consult with a healthcare provider whenever you see abnormal changes to your body, especially if they persist."
N17,response_25,"based on your description and the provided image, the bump in your underarm might be an enlarged lymph node or a skin infection, such as a boil or abscess, not usually an std. it is unlikely to be related to hiv. these can occur for various reasons, including minor infections, shaving, or use of antiperspirants. if the lump appeared very recently, it may resolve on its own. however, since you mentioned feeling feverish and fatigued, it might be a sign of your body fighting an infection. 

continue to monitor the lump - if it increases in size or does not improve after a week or two, or if you continue to experience systemic symptoms like fever, then you should definitely see a doctor. they can examine the lump and provide an accurate diagnosis. during your visit, it would be a good idea to discuss sexual health and decide whether std screening is necessary. regardless of symptoms, regular std testing is recommended for sexually active individuals. 

this advice does not replace a consultation with a healthcare provider. seek emergency medical attention if the pain becomes severe or if you start having more systemic symptoms."
