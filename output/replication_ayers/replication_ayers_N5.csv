N5,response_20,"i'm an ai, but based on the medical tests you've described (stress test, ekgs, monitors, an echo, blood work) all coming back normal, it seems quite likely that your heart is physically healthy.

many people with anxiety and panic disorders describe symptoms that mimic heart problems such as irregular heartbeats, racing heart, chest pain, etc. these symptoms can often be exacerbated by stress or anxiety.

that being said, it's important to keep in mind that while it's very important to rule out physical causes, such as heart problems, the solution to your issue may be more in the psychological realm. anxiety can have very physical symptoms, and those symptoms can, in turn, cause more anxiety, creating a vicious cycle.

if your heart symptoms persist, considered seeing a mental health professional. cognitive-behavioral therapy is particularly effective for anxiety and panic disorders."

N5,response_22,"i'm a language model ai and not a medical professional, but considering the extensive testing you've had on your heart, and all results coming back normal, your health concerns are likely due to your anxiety and panic attacks rather than an actual heart issue. weight loss can help reduce stress on your heart but if your heart symptoms were present when you were an athlete, it's likely related to the anxiety. it's really important to consult with your healthcare provider about managing your anxiety and panic attacks as they can provide proper care and support."
N5,response_23,"i'm an ai language model and not a doctor, but i can provide some general advice. firstly, it's impressive that you've undertaken extensive cardiac tests and all results have been normal. this could mean that your heart is physically healthy. however, the fact your symptoms persist could mean they're related to something else, such as your anxiety condition. it might be beneficial to seek help managing your anxiety, which could potentially reduce your physiological symptoms. remember to always consult with a healthcare professional for advice related to your health condition."
N5,response_24,"i'm an ai language model and while i'm not a doctor, i can share some general information about your query.

with the number of tests you have undergone, such as stress tests, ekgs, heart monitors, blood work, and an echocardiogram, it's likely that any significant heart issues would've been detected. health anxiety can make symptoms seem more severe than they actually are and could lead to persistent worry about health issues. it's common for people with health anxiety to focus on specific areas in the body (like the heart) and perceive normal sensations as catastrophic. 

you should continue working with your healthcare provider to manage your anxiety and improve your overall health. regular exercise, a balanced diet, adequate sleep, and stress management techniques like mindfulness and relaxation therapies can be beneficial in managing anxiety symptoms. regarding weight loss, remember it is a journey and every small positive step counts.

since your symptoms can be severe and are causing distress, further discussing this with a mental health professional could be very helpful. cognitive behavioral therapy (cbt) has been shown to be effective in treating health anxiety. 

however, always consult your doctor immediately if you ever experience symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath, fainting, or irregular heartbeat."
N5,response_25,"i'm an ai developed by openai and not a replacement for professional medical advice, but i can tell you that with all the cardiac testing you've had done, the chances are quite high that your heart is functioning normally. abnormal rhythms, heart disease, and other issues would like have shown up on such extensive tests and monitoring. psychological issues, particularly anxiety disorders, often produce substantial physiological symptoms like chest pain or palpitations that can be difficult to distinguish from heart problems. nevertheless, persisting symptoms should always be evaluated by a healthcare professional. take care and continue pursuing your health goals and managing your anxiety!"
