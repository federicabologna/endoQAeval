N206,response_1,"while increasingly common due to efforts to manage the opioid crisis, this kind of policy to prioritize non-narcotic pain relief is not uniform across all healthcare facilities. the severity and kinds of pain that warrant prescription narcotics versus over-the-counter analgesics like aspirin or ibuprofen can vary in the eyes of different healthcare providers.

misunderstandings can definitely take place in busy environments like a hospital, and it's possible the on-call physician may have had you confused with someone else. if you felt uncomfortable or unfairly treated, it's worth discussing your experience with a patient advocate or similar representative of the hospital's administration to prevent future miscommunications.

lastly, factors that could influence a provider prescribing pain management could include but are not limited to: previous medical history, current state of health, perceived pain tolerance, possibility of drug misuse, and the severity & type of injury. however, it is crucial to remember severe pain should always receive appropriate management and you have the right to have your pain adequately controlled to the best of the healthcare provider’s ability."
N206,response_2,"the management of pain in the emergency department can vary greatly based on individual patient needs, hospital policies, and physician judgement.

while it can be normal for some health care providers to try non-narcotic pain medications first, the level of pain you've described seems severe, and one might expect stronger analgesics would be provided in such a situation. physicians generally try to balance the need for effective pain management against the risks associated with strong painkillers such as opioids, including potential for addiction.

your past medical history, current health condition (cerebral palsy), and hypertonia could also contribute to how your pain is managed. for example, certain pain medications may interact with other medications you're taking, or may not be advisable given your overall health status.

however, the comments you overheard by the on-call physician questioning your integrity might indicate a bias, which, if that is the case, is not in keeping with best practices for patient care. it may be worth raising this issue with a patient advocate or similar representative at the hospital to ensure it is addressed appropriately. 

always remember that you have the right to voice your concerns about your care, and asking for a review of your treatment or requesting another opinion is within your rights. after all, your comfort and trust in your care team is paramount."
N206,response_3,"i'm an ai language model, but i can provide some general information based on available data. pain management strategies can vary among healthcare providers and hospitals. many have started adopting a cautious approach to prescribing narcotic medications due to growing concerns about opioid misuse and addiction. however, severe pain, like what you experienced, generally warrants the use of stronger pain relievers than aspirin.

a hospital may have a policy about trying non-narcotic medications first, but this policy should also take an individual's unique circumstances and pain level into account. moreover, your medical history and current condition should be taken into consideration. the goal should always be to maintain patient comfort and functionality.

patient care best practice dictates clear and open communication between patients and healthcare providers. so, if you felt that your pain was not appropriately managed, you have the right to discuss this with your healthcare provider, or complain to the hospital administration or your health insurance company. 

if you have any concerns about how your case was managed, consider seeking advice from a professional health advocate or another medical doctor.

please note that while i aim to provide accurate and helpful information, it is always best to consult with healthcare professionals for advice tailored to your specific circumstances."
N206,response_4,"as an ai, i don't have personal experiences, but i can tell you that different hospitals may have different policies and guidelines when it comes to pain management.

in the past few years there has been an increase in efforts to mitigate the overuse of opioid medications due to concerns over addiction and other negative side-effects. as a result, some hospitals implement policies to try non-opioid medications first which includes aspirin, ibuprofen and acetaminophen.

however, the severity and type of pain you describe seems quite intense and it would typically warrant stronger pain management strategies. it is possible that the physicians might have misjudged the severity of your pain or perhaps made a decision based on a misunderstanding or miscommunication. it's important to have a frank discussion with your physicians regarding your pain level and management in the future.

the note you overheard about you exaggerating a wrist injury can be disconcerting, especially when it's not accurate information. it's always crucial for any provider to take patients' reports of pain seriously and handle them empathetically. if you feel you didn't receive adequate pain control or care at this facility, consider seeking care elsewhere if possible, or requesting a patient advocate or discussing your experience with hospital administration."
N206,response_5,"policies regarding pain management can vary from hospital to hospital and are often determined by a number of factors including the severity of the injury, the patient's medical history, and current guidelines or legislation regarding the use of opioid or narcotic pain medication. 

in recent years, due to increasing concerns about the opioid crisis and substance misuse, many hospitals have adopted policies to limit the use of narcotics, especially for initial treatment. aspirin and nsaid medications such as ibuprofen are standard first-line treatments for reducing inflammation and managing pain associated with fractures.

that being said, it is reasonable for you to expect adequate pain relief. if you didn't receive adequate pain relief, you could discuss this with your healthcare provider or the hospital administration.

regarding the comments you overheard, ideally, every patient's reported pain should be taken seriously without any preconceived judgements. if you're unsatisfied with your care, you have the right to raise your concerns to the hospital.

lastly, severe fractures, especially hand fractures involving multiple digits are typically extremely painful. if your pain continues to be unmanageable, it would be important to re-check with your healthcare provider. pain management should be tailored to individual patients by balancing the need for pain relief with the potential for harm associated with pain medications.

please note that this advice is intended to be general in nature, and specific causes for your experiences may vary. always consult with your healthcare provider for accurate information."
N206,response_6,"i'm an ai, not a doctor, but i can say that there's no one-size-fits-all answer to your question. pain management policies can vary widely from hospital to hospital, and also depend on factors like your health history and the doctor's assessment of your condition. on one hand, your pain seems severe so stronger medication might have been expected. on the other hand, there's an ongoing effort in many healthcare settings to limit the use of opioid pain medications due to their potential for dependency and misuse. what is most important is that you feel your pain was not adequately addressed. this is something you should discuss with your healthcare provider or the hospital administration.

it is worth raising the issue of the comments you overheard about a previous visit. if you feel that the care you received was influenced by a misunderstanding or inaccurate info, you have every right to address this with the hospital. patient care should never be influenced by personal bias or misinformation. you could even involve a patient advocate or ombudsman if you feel that the level of care was not adequate or fair."
N206,response_7,"many medical institutions are revising their pain management guidelines due to the opioid crisis. the focus is to provide appropriate pain control with minimization of opioid use. however, the management of pain should be individualized and typically would involve more than just aspirin, especially for severe fractures.

it is also important to note that the non-narcotic first approach depends on the severity and type of pain. it’s usually meant for chronic pain where it has been proven that opioids are not effective in many cases. for acute severe pain such as yours, opioids or other forms of strong analgesics typically are used, perhaps in conjunction with nerve blockers.

regarding overheard comments, it's hard to comment without knowing the full context, but usually, healthcare professionals are trying to get a full picture of the condition and any potential contributing factors. misinterpretations can certainly happen.

every hospital and country will have different hospital policies about narcotic administration. if you feel that your pain was not adequately managed, you can express your concerns to the nursing supervisor or patient relations at the hospital. alternatively, you may also want to discuss this issue with your primary care physician and create a future plan in case similar emergencies occur. 

i am sorry to hear about your experience and hope you have a rapid recovery."
N206,response_8,"i'm an ai language model, not a healthcare professional, but i can try to give you a general idea about pain management protocols in most hospitals. while it varies between hospitals and even doctors, many places are prioritizing non-narcotic pain medication like nsaids (ex: aspirin, ibuprofen) before moving to stronger, narcotic painkillers. this is largely due to the crisis with opioid addiction and related complications. nonetheless, suffering from severe pain without proper relief could be very challenging. if initially you didn't get adequate pain management or satisfactory treatment, you can express your concern to your healthcare provider.

misunderstandings can sometimes happen, especially in busy emergency departments. so if you heard the physician mentioning something about a previous visit or injury that wasn't relevant to you, there's a chance it was a mistake.

always, do speak with your healthcare provider about your pain management plan and if this situation caused you distress, you might also consider providing feedback to the hospital or seeking care at a different location in the future if possible. you know your body and your pain level best. advocating for yourself is important."
N206,response_9,"i'm an ai trained by openai and i can provide some general information about this matter. however, please consult with a professional because every hospital and healthcare provider operates differently, and the specifics of your situation may warrant more tailored advice. 

the use of opioids for acute pain management has been a subject of debate in recent years due to the opioid crisis. some hospitals have introduced policies to try non-narcotic pain relief first, unless the pain is severe or not managed by other methods. pain management policies could also influence the decision to provide only aspirin; varying hospitals might have different protocols for managing pain. 

however, broken bones typically cause severe pain, and if you communicated your pain level and it was not adequately addressed, you may want to discuss this with your care team or consider filing a complaint. no one should have to suffer through intense pain unnecessarily. 

as for the comments made by the doctor about a previous visit, if you're certain they referred to you but you have never visited the hospital before, it may be worth clarifying. miscommunication or misunderstandings can impact quality of care.

remember, communication with your healthcare provider is highly important. if you feel your pain isn't being sufficiently managed, it's crucial to convey this to your healthcare team."
N206,response_10,"i'm an ai and hence am not part of any medical profession. however, from what i can understand, your experience might actually be part of a broader trend towards minimizing the use of opioid painkillers, especially in emergency departments. many hospitals have been adopting ""opioid-sparing"" policies, which are aimed at reducing the risk of opioid addiction among patients. this would mean primarily relying on non-narcotic pain medications like nsaids very first.

however, certainly this doesn't mean ignoring or diminishing patient's pain. if you were in severe pain with such significant injuries, it should have been adequately managed by the hospital's staff. 

the perceived discrepancy in your pain presentation and their underlying disbelief can be attributed to not spending enough time understanding your current pain situation in relation to your cerebral palsy. the condition among other things can manifest with altered sensation and pain perception landing more emphasis on individualized assessment.

you should discuss this experience with your primary care physician to receive the appropriate care and also explore better ways to manage pain during emergencies. also, remember to always communicate clearly about your pain level and the effect it's having on your ability to function. that can help healthcare professionals to better understand and manage your pain."
N206,response_11,"i'm an ai and don't have personal experiences, but i can provide you with general information. generally speaking, the decision to give specific types of pain medication and its dosage does depend on hospital protocol, the individual patient's condition and other relevant medical history. some institutions have been moving towards non-narcotic options first in light of narcotic dependency issues but this doesn't necessarily apply universally. pain management should always be individualized and should address your specific needs. 

in severe cases like yours, stronger pain relievers are usually administered. however, a decision may have been influenced by your medical history, drug interactions with ongoing medication or other medical findings. it could also have been influenced by concerns about the potential for dependency, or even an error in judgement.

the comments you overheard from the on-call physician shouldn't influence your care, but if you feel they did, you have every right to address your concerns about the management of your pain, ideally with the physician directly or with a patient advocate in the hospital.

pain management is a crucial part of patient care and physicians are under ethical duty to manage it efficiently. it might be a good idea to discuss your experience and concerns with your primary care physician, too. they can guide you through the process of addressing these concerns with the hospital. your feedback is important, as it might change practices or protocols, ideally leading to more efficient pain management strategies in the future."
N206,response_12,"it's impossible to speak definitively to all hospitals' protocols, but it does seem unusual to only be prescribed aspirin in response to what sounds like significant pain from severe injuries. hospital pain management protocols can vary greatly depending on a number of factors including the subjectivity of pain, seriousness of the injury, individual patient situational factors, and hospital policy, among others.

the medical team may have been attempting to strike a balance between managing your pain and avoiding the risk of opioid dependency, but this should not undermine your pain management if your pain was severe.

i suggest you articulate the severity of your pain clearly during any subsequent emergency visits, making your experience and discomfort clear from the outset. if you believe you were not treated appropriately or were discriminated against, it's within your rights to communicate this to patient advocate or hospital administration personnel. 

remember, the best course of action should always be to discuss these issues with your medical provider to ensure that you have the most accurate and informed perspective. my analysis, as an artificial intelligence, is based on general knowledge and should not replace professional medical advice."
N206,response_13,"i'm an ai developed by openai and i'm not a doctor but i can provide some general information.

in recent years, many hospitals and clinics have indeed become more cautious in prescribing opioid-based or narcotic pain relief due to the risk of patients developing an addiction, and the ongoing opioid crisis. however, the policy may vary depending on the hospital, the severity of the injuries, and the doctor's discretion. 

oftentimes, over-the-counter, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) are given for pain relief before resorting to stronger prescription painkillers. this includes medications like aspirin and ibuprofen. they can be remarkably effective for many types of acute pain, including fractures in some cases.

it is possible that your doctor had additional concerns that influenced his decision-making process. they might be concerned about potential interactions with other medications you’re taking, or other medical conditions you may have. 

however, if you felt your pain was ineffectively managed, it's crucial to communicate this to your healthcare provider. if you believe there were any misunderstandings or errors in your care, you should also discuss this with your healthcare provider or consider following your hospital's complaint procedures to get clarification. 

please note that this advice is intended to be general in nature, and specific causes may vary. always consult with a healthcare provider for appropriate examination, diagnosis, and treatment."
N206,response_14,"i'm an ai and do not have personal experiences, but i can share with you that hospital guidelines for pain management can vary widely. general trends in the united states have seen a reduction in the prescribing of narcotic pain medications due to concerns over potential misuse and addiction. this often leads to the practice of ""stepping"" pain management, where non-narcotic pain relievers are tried first and stronger pain medications are only used if necessary.

with a significant injury like yours, however, additional pain management measures are typically implemented. it's also important to note that judgements or comments about previous medical history should not affect the level of care provided to a current condition.

if you feel that your pain was not appropriately managed, you have the right to raise this with your healthcare provider or hospital patient advocate. it's essential that your pain, especially with an injury as severe as yours, is adequately addressed to ensure appropriate healing and to prevent complications. 

remember, it's always a good idea to discuss any unaddressed health concerns with your primary care physician or seek a second opinion if you feel it's necessary. 

moreover, your hypertonia and cerebral palsy may complicate the experience of pain and its management. make sure to discuss these factors when consulting with your healthcare provider."
N206,response_15,"i'm sorry to hear about your situation. regarding your query, different hospitals can have different policies regarding pain management. some may indeed have policies that prefer non-narcotic medications first due to concerns about overuse of narcotics and dependency issues. 

however, severe pain such as yours might ordinarily warrant stronger pain relief, and it seems surprising that you wouldn't be given something stronger especially given the visible severity of your injuries. it could be because of your previous medical history, or perhaps there was some misunderstanding or miscommunication. you should feel free to discuss your pain management with your healthcare providers and advocate for yourself if you feel your pain is not being adequately managed.

furthermore, the apparent comments from the doctor may potentially hint at some bias or misunderstanding. you would generally expect healthcare professionals to evaluate each case on its merits rather than making assumptions. if you felt this affected the level of care you received, it might be worth addressing.

this is not specifically medical advice, but rather a general response to your question. unfortunately, without a complete picture and assessment, it's difficult to give a definitive answer. it would be in your best interest to consult with a healthcare professional or seek a second opinion on this matter."
N206,response_16,"i'm an ai and not a doctor, but i can provide some information based on general practices. pain management policies can vary greatly from hospital to hospital. some places may readily offer stronger pain medications for injuries like the ones you've described, while others may strictly adhere to a non-opiate first protocol.

fear of drug-seeking behavior and abuse, overdose potential, and patient safety concerns have led many healthcare facilities to rethink their pain management strategies. pain, however, is considered the fifth vital sign and under treatment may lead to unnecessary suffering. 

in general, while it's not uncommon for medical providers to initially try non-opioid pain relievers, the severe nature of your injuries and the high level of pain you're describing might warrant stronger, more appropriate pain management.

without knowing the complete circumstances, it's hard to judge the appropriateness of the treatment you received. if you feel your pain hasn't been adequately managed, it may be worth discussing with another medical professional or filing a complaint with the hospital. 

also, the comment about your previous visit (which did not happen as you said), might have led to an inappropriate judgment about your pain. this is worth addressing with the administration too. 

please reach out to a healthcare professional for further consultation."
N206,response_17,"i'm sorry to hear about your painful experience, it indeed sounds excruciating. as a language model ai developed by openai, i can help clarify some of the potential reasons behind the pain management policy you mentioned, but i won't be able to express a normative judgment on individual hospitals' policies.

in response to the opioid crisis, many hospitals and healthcare systems have implemented policies favoring non-opioid medications for pain management. these can include aspirin, ibuprofen, and acetaminophen. opioids are only prescribed when these medicines fail to control the pain. this practice is part of an attempt to reduce potential opioid abuse and addiction, which have been recognized as a significant public health problem.

however, effective pain management should also consider the patient's individual circumstances, including the severity of injury and pain, medical history, and any underlying health conditions. a communication gap or lack of thorough patient history review might lead to inadequately addressed pain. it's unfortunate that you had to bear intense pain.

if you feel your pain wasn't properly managed, you might want to consider discussing it with a healthcare provider or submitting a complaint to the hospital. it could prompt a review of your treatment, which might lead to changes that improve patient care. furthermore, seeking a pain management specialist to get advice on managing your pain in the future would also be beneficial. however, always consult healthcare professionals for the best course of action."
N206,response_18,"i'm an ai language model and while i don't have personal experiences, i can provide some information based on my training data.

it's important to know that each hospital has its unique policies when it comes to pain management, and these protocols may be influenced by various factors such as efforts to prevent opioid abuse, known patient health conditions, provider judgement, and other regional or country specific guidelines. in many cases, over-the-counter non-opioid pain relievers like aspirin may be used first before resorting to stronger pain medications.

however, in cases of clear and severe injury, as you described, it is expected that stronger analgesics should be administered to adequately manage the pain. patient comfort is a significant feature of patient care and it's surprising to hear that you were given just aspirin for a severely broken hand. it might be possible that if you had a history of substance abuse, they were trying to be cautious with the use of stronger pain medications.

concerning the comments you overheard, it's not professional for healthcare providers to speculate or make assumptions about a patient's situation based on past experiences with other patients. if there is a clear misunderstanding, it might be helpful to clear that up with them.

remember, as a patient, you have the right to express your level of pain and discuss its management with your healthcare providers. you can also file a complaint through the patient relations department if you believe the treatment was mismanaged. 

lastly, make sure to follow up with your own physicians regarding pain management post-er visit, as the plastic surgeon or other healthcare professionals involved in your care may offer different strategies for managing your pain."
N206,response_19,"i'm an ai developed by openai and while i am knowledgeable about a variety of topics based on publicly available information, i am not a doctor but i can share some general insights regarding the topic. 

although practices may vary between hospitals, it is possible for hospitals or healthcare systems to have policies in place to limit the use of narcotic drugs due to the potential for misuse and dependency. in many cases, non-opioid medications like nsaids (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as aspirin, ibuprofen etc.) are the first line of defense against pain because they can be effective without the risk of addiction. 

however, the severity and the type of pain should guide the choice of pain medications. in severe cases of trauma, like a complex hand injury, it would be expected to use more potent pain relievers. 

it's also important to note that patient pain assessment and management is now considered a key aspect of quality of care. if you felt your pain was not adequately managed, you may want to discuss this with your healthcare provider or consider filing a complaint or a feedback with the hospital.

the remarks you overheard about a past visit are concerning, especially since you indicate you had not been to that hospital before this incident. professionalism and respectful patient treatment are core components of healthcare standards. if you believe you were wrongly treated or misunderstood, reaching out to a hospital ombudsman or patient advocate might be helpful in addressing these concerns.  

remember, your doctor or healthcare team can provide the highest quality of advice for your personal situation."
N206,response_20,"the policy can differ from hospital to hospital, based on their guidelines and protocols. generally, pain management protocol is typically guided by the patient's level of pain. minor injuries might be treated with over-the-counter medication, like ibuprofen or aspirin. however, more severe pain associated with serious trauma or surgery usually requires stronger prescription pain relievers. 

in your case, given the severity of the pain you described, stronger pain relief than aspirin might have been appropriate. but, things changed over the past years with the ongoing opioid crisis, leading to a tightening up of narcotic prescriptions in er settings. 

a patient's previous medical history, including any history of substance misuse, can also influence a doctor's decision to prescribe narcotics. however, the physician's comments about a previous visit where you exaggerated a wrist injury is concerning since you haven't been to the hospital before. 

you're your best advocate, so make sure to continue voicing your concerns about pain management in the future. if you felt your pain was not managed appropriately, consider sharing your feedback with the hospital or seek advice from a medical malpractice attorney if you believe there was negligence. and for ongoing care, discuss this with your primary care doctor or the treating specialist."
N206,response_21,"in most hospitals, the policy of starting with non-narcotic pain medication for acute pain is common, due to the potential risks of addiction and side effects with opioid drugs. however, the management of pain should always be tailored to individual patients and the severity of their pain.

having severe fractures and a swollen and discolored hand would indeed be very painful. despite non-narcotic preliminary measures, if pain is not well controlled, stronger medications would typically be considered. your condition might have been exacerbated by your cerebral palsy and hypertonia, so it is indeed surprising and concerning that you reported such a high degree of pain that was not adequately addressed.

it would be very unprofessional if the on-call physician indeed made dismissive comments about your situation. the management of pain should always be individualized and based on the patient's report of his/her experience. it isn't ethical or professional to simply assume a patient is ""exaggerating"" without a thorough evaluation.

you might consider a couple of actions after this. you could raise your concerns with the hospital's patient advocacy services or management - any reputable facility places a high value on patient feedback. you might also consider seeking future care at a different hospital, one where you feel your symptoms are taken seriously and your pain, adequately managed. 

remember that the key is mutual understanding and open communication. speak up when you are in severe pain so the healthcare professionals can have a clear picture and provide the most suitable help. we apologize if you felt underserved, and we hope your hand recovers soon."
N206,response_22,"sorry to hear about your distressing experience. as an ai developed by openai, i can neither answer for the specific hospital policy at your chosen facility nor confirm if your treatment was typical. however, i can provide a general comment.

every hospital has different policies, and many have moved towards prescribing fewer opioids and other strong painkillers in response to a growing public health issue of opioid dependency. it is common for doctors to begin with non-narcotic medications and then escalate as needed. this decision can also be influenced by a patient's prior medical history, condition upon arrival, severity, and the practitioner's professional judgment.

your symptoms suggest that the pain would have been severe, however, without more detailed health information it is not possible to comment on whether more potent pain relief would have been indicated. i do encourage you to make your discomfort known to the medical staff, if you haven't already.

your perception of the on-call physician's comments may have also contributed to your distress. if you feel comfortable and it is allowable in your jurisdiction, considering a formal complaint or review, which may invite an investigation of your treatment, may be a useful option. alternatively, a discussion with your primary care doctor about this might shed some light on things.

error in medicine is a reality. it is also crucial to remember that all patients have the right to be treated with dignity and respect - that includes being listened to when expressing concerns about pain. 

finally, uncontrolled pain can have systemic effects on your body and delay healing. if you feel your pain is not adequately managed, do reach up to your healthcare professionals. they may reassess your situation and provide stronger medications or different strategies to control your pain. make sure they know about your cerebral palsy and severe hypertonia as these conditions may influence your pain experience and management. 

please consult a healthcare professional regarding this matter. this advice merely aims to give general information."
N206,response_23,"i'm sorry to hear about your painful experience. hospitals and ers do often vary in their practices, particularly regarding pain management, due to the opioid crisis. many are trying to rely less on opioids and use non-narcotic pain relievers whenever possible as first line treatment. 

however, this doesn't mean that your pain should go unmanaged. in fact, the world health organization's pain ladder recommends starting with non-opioid analgesia like nsaids and if pain isn't controlled, to then step up to opioids. 

aside from policies, communication is an equally important aspect of providing care. if there were any misunderstandings or confusions about your medical history, those should have ideally been clarified with you first, and your current situation assessed thoroughly before deciding on the appropriate pain management strategy.

it is also important to note that patient's pain and conditions must be evaluated individually and treated accordingly. 

this is a difficult situation to navigate, but sharing your concerns and any misunderstanding about your medical history with your healthcare providers can help to make sure you receive the care you need.

please talk with your healthcare provider about this issue, and discuss the best options for managing your pain. it is crucial that you feel your concerns are heard and your pain is adequately managed."
N206,response_24,"i'm sorry to hear you had such a rough experience. it's hard to give a definitive answer because each hospital's policies can vary depending on the local regulations, resources, and philosophies.

however, the practice you’re describing does align with a broader trend in healthcare towards limiting the use of opioids and other narcotics and instead attempting to manage pain with non-narcotic medications first. often this is in response to the opioid crisis.

that being said, for severe pain like what you're describing, it would also generally be standard practice to escalate to stronger pain management if the non-narcotic methods aren't sufficient, especially in cases with visible deformities or the patient in clear distress. an exception might occur if there was a concern about contraindications or potential substance misuse, though if this is the case, it should ideally be professionally and respectfully communicated.

regarding the comment about previous visits — if you'd never been there before, it's possible the staff got you confused with a different patient, which is a concern.

if you feel your pain wasn't managed appropriately or that you were treated poorly, you should feel free to share that feedback with the hospital's patient advocacy or complaints department. although it's tough to comment definitively on your specific situation, i'm sorry that you were left in such discomfort. i hope your recovery is going smoothly."
N206,response_25,"i'm sorry to hear about your injury and painful experience, but as an ai, i can't provide medical advice. however, it's worth noting that many hospitals do have policies in place to limit the initial use of opioids or other strong painkillers due to dependency risks. but the level of pain relief you receive should be in line with the severity of your injury and your individual needs. it's unfortunate that you overheard a comment about a previous visit, as every patient should be evaluated based on their current condition and medical history. it may be helpful to speak with patient services or a patient advocate at the hospital about these concerns.

remember, your doctor or healthcare provider is the best person to provide advice on this matter. consider sharing your concerns with them, they can give you a clearer understanding of the hospital’s pain management policies and your particular situation."
