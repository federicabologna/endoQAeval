N74,response_20,"i'm really sorry to hear that you've been exposed to such a traumatic experience. it definitely sounds like you could be experiencing symptoms of acute stress disorder or possibly shock, which can sometimes happen after viewing or being involved in a traumatic event. it's completely normal to feel numb, confused, and disconnected from reality and emotions. this is your brain's way of protecting you from the intense feelings caused by the event, an instinctual mechanism for survival.

it's important to remember that everyone processes trauma differently, and your feelings or lack thereof are valid. it's nothing to feel guilty or concerned about - it's not indicative of lacking empathy.

however, it's really important you get some professional help to work through this. reach out to a mental health professional who can provide guidance and support. it might also be helpful to discuss this with someone you trust, who can offer emotional support. 

remember, it's okay to take care of yourself right now â€“ try some self-care activities, such as reading a book, engaging in light exercise, or listening to calming music, whatever aids relaxation for you. being in a new place might feel isolating, but try not to isolate yourself emotionally. connect with friends or family on a call or video chat.

i echo strongly that you should seek professional help. this isn't overreacting, your feelings are valid and very real. please take care."

N74,response_24,"i'm sorry to hear that you're going through this. it does definitely sound like you could be experiencing a form of psychological shock or trauma. it's common for people who have experienced a traumatic event to feel numb, disconnected, or confused, and not knowing exactly how to process it. part of this could be your brain's protective mechanism, trying to shield you from the full impact of what you've witnessed. 

it's also totally normal not to feel anything immediately afterwards. the shock has not worn off yet, and it often takes time for the full emotional impact of what happened to truly hit you. trauma can affect us all differently, some people might cry and be visibly upset, others might repress their feelings or appear stoic because that's just how they cope. 

for now, try your best to take care of yourself and reach out to someone you trust about what you're going through. also, if these feelings persist, it might be beneficial to seek professional help such as by speaking to a therapist or counselor. that said, remember that everyone handles shocking events differently. what you're experiencing is valid and you most certainly aren't overreacting. 

finally, i would urge you to contact a mental health professional to discuss these feelings. they are equipped to give you the most helpful and relevant guidance."
