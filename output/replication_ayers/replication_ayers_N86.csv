N86,response_1,"i'm an ai language model and not a physician, but i can offer a simplified explanation for your xray report:

1. the last fully formed disc space is designated as l5-s1: the lumbar spine (backbone) is typically composed of 5 vertebrae, labeled l1-l5. s1 is the first vertebra of the sacral region, right below the lumbar region. the report is noting where this disc is in your spine.

2. no acute fracture; intact vertebral body heights: you do not have any recent broken bones in your spine and the height of your vertebrae is normal. 

3. no significant listhesis. minor lumbar levocurvature: listhesis refers to the alignment of the vertebrae. no significant listhesis means your vertebrae are generally well aligned in their column. a minor lumbar levocurvature implies a slight leftward curve of your lower spine.

4. l5-s1 degenerative disc disease with vacuum disc and discogenic sclerosis, and milder degenerative disc space narrowing/endplate spurring at the remaining levels: there are signs of wear-and-tear related changes (degeneration) at the disc between your l5 and s1 vertebrae. vacuum disc is a term used when air or gas accumulates in the disc space, which can be a sign of degeneration. discogenic sclerosis refers to hardening or thickening of the disc. the rest of the discs are showing milder signs of age or wear-and-tear related changes, like narrowing of the space between the discs and small bone growths (spurs).

5. mild facet arthropathy, greatest at l5-s1: the facet joints are the small joints at each segment of the spine that provide stability and allow for movement. arthopathy refers to any disorder of these joints. there is mild disease in these joints, most significant in the l5-s1 area.

6. no other significant findings: apart from what has already been noted, there are no other significant or concerning findings from the images taken of your lumbar spine.

this is general information meant to help understanding and isn't definitive medical advice. it's best to consult with your healthcare provider for more accurate interpretation."
N86,response_2,"i am an ai language model developed by openai and can help summarize this radiology report for you, i should note however, i am not a doctor.

your x-ray report discusses the state of your lower back (lumbar spine). here are the key points translated into simpler terms:

1. ""no acute fracture; intact vertebral body heights"" - you don't have any broken bones in your back and the height of your spinal bones is normal.

2. ""no significant listhesis."" - your vertebrae, the stack of bones making up the spine, are in alignment. they aren't slipping forwards or backwards from their normal positions.

3. ""minor lumbar levocurvature"" - your lower spine has a slight curve to the left. this is typically not a major concern unless it is causing symptoms.

4. ""l5-s1 degenerative disc disease with vacuum disc and discogenic sclerosis"" - the disc between your l5 and s1 vertebrae (the lowest lumbar disc and the first sacral vertebra) has signs of wear and tear (degenerative disc disease). the ""vacuum disc"" might refer to gas trapped in the disc, and ""discogenic sclerosis"" refers to hardening or scarring of the disc due to disease.

5. ""milder degenerative disc space narrowing/endplate spurring at the remaining levels"" - the spaces between some of the other spine segments have gotten a little bit narrower because of mild wear and tear, and there are small bone growths (""spurs"") on the endplates of the vertebral bodies.

6. ""mild facet arthropathy, greatest at l5-s1."" - there is a slight degeneration or inflammation in the facet joints (small stabilizing joints between and behind adjacent vertebrae), especially between your l5 and s1 vertebrae.

7. ""no other significant findings."" - aside from these findings, the radiologist didn't find anything else remarkable. 

please follow up with your healthcare provider for further discussion regarding these findings."
N86,response_3,"here are your x-ray results simplified:

""the last fully formed disc space is designated as l5-s1."" - the lowest disc in your spine, one that separates the last lumbar vertebra (l5) and the first sacral vertebra (s1), is visible and well-formed.

""no acute fracture; intact vertebral body heights."" - there are no fresh or critical bone fractures in your spine. the vertebrae (the bones that make up your spine) are all a normal height.

""no significant listhesis. minor lumbar levocurvature."" - your vertebrae are not significantly misaligned (listhesis). there is a minor left-sided curve (levocurvature) in your lower (lumbar) spine, which isn't unusual.

""l5-s1 degenerative disc disease with vacuum disc and discogenic sclerosis, and milder degenerative disc space narrowing/endplate spurring at the remaining levels."" - the disc between the l5 and s1 vertebrae is showing signs of wear and tear (degenerative disc disease). this includes a vacuum disc (an air or gas-filled space in the disc, indicating degeneration), and discogenic sclerosis (hardening of the disc area). the spaces between the other discs are narrowing a bit, and the ends of the vertebrae are developing some small bone spurs. this is also a sign of degenerative changes but is less severe than at the l5-s1 level.

""mild facet arthropathy, greatest at l5-s1."" - the facet joints of the vertebrae (the small, stabilizing joints between and behind adjacent vertebrae) are showing minor wear-and-tear changes. this is most noticeable at the l5-s1 level.

""no other significant findings."" - no other noticeable abnormalities were found.

so, in simple terms, you have some signs of wear and tear in your lower spine, especially at the lowest disc (l5-s1).  this is not uncommon as people age, but if you're experiencing pain or discomfort you should discuss this with your doctor. they can provide you with advice on managing any symptoms and slowing down the progression of these changes."
N86,response_4,"here's the layman's explanation of your radiologist report:

1. the last fully formed disc space is designated as l5-s1: 

   this means the lowest disc in your spine (located between the fifth lumbar vertebra and first sacral vertebra) is referred to as l5-s1.

2. no acute fracture; intact vertebral body heights:

   there are no new, sudden fractures in your spine and the heights of each bone (vertebral body) in your spine are normal.

3. no significant listhesis. minor lumbar levocurvature:

   there isn't a significant slippage of one vertebral bone over another (listhesis). there is a slight leftward curve (levocurvature) of your lower spine (lumbar spine), which is normal variation.

4. l5-s1 degenerative disc disease with vacuum disc and discogenic sclerosis, and milder degenerative disc space narrowing/endplate spurring at the remaining levels:

   the disc between the fifth lumbar vertebra and first sacral vertebra (l5-s1) has degenerative changes, meaning the disc is wearing down and degenerating. this includes the development of gas within the disc space (termed a vacuum disc), and the edges of the vertebrae adjacent to the disc are showing signs of hardening (sclerosis). the other disc spaces in your lumbar spine are also showing milder changes of wearing down.

5. mild facet arthropathy, greatest at l5-s1:

   the joints where the vertebrae connect together (the facet joints) in your spine are showing signs of degeneration, mainly at l5-s1 level.

6. no other significant findings:

   there are no other important or potentially harmful findings in your x-ray.

keep in mind that while these findings may sound concerning, they are in many cases normal signs of aging and not necessarily indicators of a serious health problem. always discuss with your doctor about any concerns or questions you might have."
N86,response_5,"i'm an ai, but i can try to translate this into simpler terms for you. 

your report seems to indicate a few structural changes in your spine:

- first, it mentions that the last disc in your lower back is known as l5-s1. this is standard anatomy.
- you have no acute fractures or injuries, and the vertical bodies of your backbone are intact.
- you have minor leftward curvature of your lower spine, but not any significant slipping of vertebrae over each other.
- you have degeneration at your l5-s1 disc, the final one at your lower spine. this manifests itself through a vacuum disc (an area of gas within the disc itself that often signifies degeneration), increased bone formation due to stress/usage (discogenic sclerosis), as well as some shrinkage or spurring of the disc space. this degeneration is lesser at other levels of your spine.
- you have mild arthritis (facet arthropathy) in your facet joints, which are small stabilizing joints located between and behind adjacent vertebrae, and the condition is most severe at the l5-s1 joint.
- the x-rays doesn't show any other significant findings.

you should discuss this report with your healthcare provider who can give you more personalized and accurate advice based on your symptoms and the full picture of your health. the meaning of these changes can vary widely depending on other factors like your symptoms, past medical history etc."
N86,response_6,"i am an ai language model and not a doctor, but i can help simplify the medical terminology here.

this report is saying that:

- you don't have any new broken bones and the height of your vertebrae (the bones making up your spine) is normal.
- your spine is not misaligned in a significant way, although there is slight curvature to the left in the lower area of your back (lumbar region).
- the disc between your lowest spine bone (l5) and your sacrum (s1) shows signs of wear and tear (this is called degenerative disc disease). there's also signs of a ""vacuum disc"" which denotes a disc space where some of the material inside the disc has disappeared likely due to degeneration. additionally, there's some hardening (sclerosis) in the disc area.
- there are minor changes due to wear and tear in the remaining discs of your spine as well, but they are less severe.
- you have mild facet arthropathy, which means some arthritis-like changes in the joints of your spine, most significantly again in that lower back l5-s1 area.
- there are no other significant findings to report.

remember, this should not be regarded as professional medical advice. please consult your doctor for accurate and appropriate information."
N86,response_7,"sure, i'd be happy to help you interpret these findings. note that i'm an ai and not a real doctor, but here's a simpler description:

the ""last fully formed disc space is designated as l5-s1"" just means they're identifying and labeling the lowest part of your spine where there’s still a disc.

""no acute fracture; intact vertebral body heights"" means there aren't any recent broken bones (fractures) and the height of your spinal bones (vertebrae) looks normal.

""no significant listhesis. minor lumbar levocurvature."" means there's no significant slip of one of your vertebrae over the one below it. the minor levocurvature refers to a small curve to the left in your lower back (lumbar) region.

""l5-s1 degenerative disc disease with vacuum disc and discogenic sclerosis, and milder degenerative disc space narrowing/endplate spurring at the remaining levels."" this means there is some degeneration (wear and tear) in the disc between the l5 and s1 vertebrae of your lower spine. vacuum disc is when gas is present in the disc space, and discogenic sclerosis refers to hardening or scarring of the disc. also, there's a milder degree of degeneration in the space between the other vertebrae, with some bony outgrowths/spurs.

""mild facet arthropathy, greatest at l5-s1."" means there's some degeneration of the small joints of the spine (facet joints), most notably in the l5-s1 region.

""no other significant findings"" means they didn't find any other notable issues in your x-ray.

just remember, it's important to discuss these results with your healthcare provider to understand what they mean for you and your health. they can offer advice on any necessary treatments or next steps."
N86,response_8,"i am an ai not a doctor, but i can help put the jargon in simpler terms for you: 

your radiologist is saying the following: 

* the last full spinal disc in your back is called the l5-s1. they just note this to set a reference point for the conversation.
* there are no acute fractures, meaning you have no fresh or severe broken bones in the area that was scanned. they also note that your vertebral body heights (basically, the size of your vertebrae) are normal. 
* there is no ""significant listhesis."" listhesis refers to the alignment of your spine, so they're saying that your spine is pretty much aligned the way it should be. you do have minor lumbar levocurvature, which simply means your lower spine slightly curves to the left, but it's minor.
* at your l5-s1 disc (the spot at the bottom of your spine), there are signs of wear and tear, known as degenerative disc disease. this includes a vacuum disc, which basically means there are air or gas pockets in the disc, and discogenic sclerosis, which means there is some hardening or scarring of the disc. it is noted that similar, but milder, degenerative changes are seen in other levels of your spine.
* mild facet arthropathy, greatest at l5-s1. this means you have slight degenerative changes (like arthritis) in the joints of your spine, it's most notable at the bottom of your spine.
* no other significant findings mean they didn't find anything else noteworthy or concerning.

please reach out to a healthcare provider for any diagnosis or further explanation! this aims to just roughly simplify the terminology in the report."
N86,response_9,"here's the simplified version of your x-ray results:

- the last fully formed disc space is designated as l5-s1. 
this simply means the place where the lowest part of your spine (the lumbar spine) connects to your tailbone (the sacrum) is being called l5-s1.

- no acute fracture; intact vertebral body heights.  
your vertebral bones have not been fractured or broken and the heights of your vertebral bodies (the main portion of the bones in your spine) are normal.

- no significant listhesis. minor lumbar levocurvature.  
you have no major forward or backward slippage (listhesis) of the spinal bones. there's a minor leftward curvature (levocurvature) of the lower part of your spine, but it's not a major concern.

- l5-s1 degenerative disc disease with vacuum disc and discogenic sclerosis, and milder degenerative disc space narrowing/endplate spurring at the remaining levels.  
the disc at the lowest part of your spine (l5-s1 level) is deteriorating- a condition commonly referred to as degenerative disc disease. in addition, there is a vacuum phenomenon, which is usually a sign of degenerative disc disease and can cause back pain. the bone around the disc is also hardened (sclerosis). other discs in your spine also show signs of less severe degeneration with narrowing of the space between them and growth of bone spurs at the endplates (edges of these vertebrae).

- mild facet arthropathy, greatest at l5-s1.  
the joints that connect your spinal bones (facet joints) are also showing signs of wear and tear (arthropathy), with the most significant changes at the bottom of your spine (the l5-s1 level).

- no other significant findings.
other than the conditions described above, the radiologist didn't find anything else of noteworthy concern."
N86,response_10,"let's break down the findings:

1. ""the last fully formed disc space is designated as l5-s1."" this just refers to the way they're identifying and labeling the vertebrae in your spine. l5-s1 is the disc located between the fifth lumbar vertebra and the first sacral vertebra.

2. ""no acute fracture; intact vertebral body heights."" this is good news. it means you don't have any recent fractures in your spine, and the height of your vertebrae look normal.

3. ""no significant listhesis."" another good thing. this means your vertebrae aren't slipping forward or backward over each other.

4. ""minor lumbar levocurvature."" this means you have a minor leftward curve in your lower spine. it's very common and usually not something to worry about unless it's causing you pain or discomfort.

5. ""l5-s1 degenerative disc disease with vacuum disc and discogenic sclerosis."" this means that the disc between your fifth lumbar vertebra and first sacral vertebra is showing signs of degeneration (wear and tear). the 'vacuum disc' refers to gas trapped in the disc space, a common sign of disc degeneration. the term 'discogenic sclerosis' describes changes in the bone underneath the disc due to the degenerative process.

6. ""milder degenerative disc space narrowing/endplate spurring at the remaining levels."" this suggests mild wear and tear in the other discs of your spine. 'endplate spurring' refers to bone spurs, which are projections that form along joint margins.

7. ""mild facet arthropathy, greatest at l5-s1."" the facet joints are found at each vertebral level in the spine, aiding its flexibility. arthropathy is disease of these joints. yours shows mild disease, mostly at the level of l5-s1.

8. ""no other significant findings."" this means there's nothing else noteworthy or concerning about the x-ray.

in simpler terms, your x-ray shows some wear-and-tear changes in your lower spine, more in some places than others, but there are no fractures or major spinal alignment issues. bez sure to discuss these findings with your doctor for a more personalized understanding of your medical situation."
N86,response_11,"here's how i would explain your radiology report:

the report is about the imaging of your lower back (lumber spine).

* the last completely formed disc space is labeled as l5-s1, this is the terminology for the lowest part of your spine where it meets your sacrum.
* you don't have any new (acute) spinal fractures and the heights of your vertebrae (the bones making up your spine) are normal. 
* there's no significant listhesis (which means your vertebrae are not significantly shifted or slipped in relation to one another), but you have a minor lumbar levocurvature. this simply means that your lower spine curves slightly to the left. it's usually not a concerning finding.
* at the l5-s1 level, a condition called degenerative disc disease is noted which includes vacuum disc (spaces within the disc that contain air or another gas instead of normal disc material) and discogenic sclerosis (hardening or calcification of the disc). this is a common condition causing pain, and usually results from aging or wear and tear on the spine.
* above the l5-s1, there's milder disc space narrowing (the cushions between your vertebrae are a bit thinner than they should be) and endplate spurring (small bone spurs or outgrowths). these are also common findings in many adults, especially as they get older.
* you also have mild facet arthropathy (changes to the facet joints, which connect the spine's vertebrae) and it is greatest at l5-s1. facet arthropathy can cause stiffness or pain in the lower back.
* there were no other significant or worrisome findings noticed in your x-ray.

in summary, your report suggests parts of your lower spine (especially at l5-s1) show signs of typical aging or wear and tear, which can cause symptoms like pain or discomfort. nothing acute or emergent was noted. discuss these findings with your doctor or spine specialist as they can provide further treatment guidance."
N86,response_12,"i'm not a doctor, but i can provide a basic understanding of this report.

your results show:

- no acute fracture; intact vertebral body heights: this means there is no immediate or recent break of the bones in your lower spine, and the height of the individual bones that make up your spine are normal.

- no significant listhesis: this refers to a condition where one of the bones in your spine slips forward or backward over the bone below it. ""no significant listhesis"" means that this isn't occurring to a large extent in your lumbar spine.

- minor lumbar levocurvature: this means there is a slight curve to the left in the lumbar (lower) region of your spine.

- l5-s1 degenerative disc disease with vacuum disc and discogenic sclerosis: basically, the disc between the fifth lumbar vertebra and the first sacral vertebra (l5-s1) is degenerating, or breaking down, which is a common part of aging. vacuum disc refers to gas (frequently nitrogen) that has built up in the disc space. discogenic sclerosis is a hardening (or sclerosis) due to degeneration.

- milder degenerative disc space narrowing/endplate spurring at the remaining levels: the spaces between your other vertebrae are narrowing slightly and there are small bone spurs (endplate spurs) on the vertebrae. both these issues are also common with aging.

- mild facet arthropathy, greatest at l5-s1: the facet joints link the vertebrae together and help stabilize the spine. mild facet arthropathy at l5-s1 means there is slight degeneration or inflammation in the facet joint at this level.

- no other significant findings: nothing else unusual was found in your x-ray that would indicate a problem.

remember to follow up with your doctor to discuss these results and what they might mean for your health."
N86,response_13,"i'd be happy to explain!

when the report describes the last fully formed disc space as l5-s1, they are identifying the lowest lumbar vertebra (l5) and the first sacral vertebra (s1) - the area between these is the last part of your spine where disc is found.

""no acute fracture; intact vertebral body heights"": this simply means there are no sudden or severe fractures and the height of your vertebrae is fine. basically, your spinal bones are intact and at a normal height.

""no significant listhesis. minor lumbar levocurvature"": listhesis refers to the displacement of a vertebra. in your case, no significant spinal misalignment or slipping was found. additionally, a minor levocurvature means that your lumbar spine (lower back area) has a slight leaning that is usually towards the left.

""l5-s1 degenerative disc disease with vacuum disc and discogenic sclerosis, and milder degenerative disc space narrowing/endplate spurring at the remaining levels"": degenerative disc disease at your l5-s1 disc indicates that this specific spinal disc is wearing down over time (think of it as wear and tear). a vacuum disc is a condition where gas builds up in the disc space, often occurring with degeneration. discogenic sclerosis refers to hardening of the vertebral body as a response to the disc degeneration. what they're saying is that there's a slight narrowing of the other disc spaces and some bone spurring (extra bone growth) as well.

""mild facet arthropathy, greatest at l5-s1"" means that the facet joints (the parts of your vertebrae that let your spine move and twist) have some wear and tear, and it's most apparent at the junction between your last lumbar vertebra and first sacral vertebra.

""no other significant findings"": nothing else of abnormality was found in your x-ray. 

basically, the main findings are a bit of wear and tear (degeneration) in parts of your spine, most notably at the lower end (l5-s1). this is fairly common, particularly as people age or due to certain conditions. it's generally manageable with the right treatment, although can be a source of back discomfort or pain. please consult with your physician for advice tailored to your specific situation."
N86,response_14,"here is your report written in a way that might be easier to understand:

the starting point for naming the discs in your lower back is being identified as l5-s1. this is normal.

* there is no sudden break or collapse of the structures in your backbone.
* there isn't any significant movement of one backbone on top of another. there's a slight leftward curve in your lower spine which is usually harmless and might not cause any problems.
* there's some natural wear and tear at the l5-s1 disc in your lower spine that's quite common as people grow older. this involves some loss of water in the disc (referred to as a vacuum disc and discogenic sclerosis) which can make it lose its height, and a bit of growth or spurring on the bone ends that are near the disc. you also have similar, but less pronounced, changes in your other lower back discs.
* you have some mild arthritis in the tiny joints at the back of your spine, especially at the level of the l5-s1. arthritis, or 'wear and tear', in these joints is also a common part of aging.
* no other issues have been found in your x-ray. 

so, overall, this report describes some common degenerative changes in your spine which happen as we age. depending on your symptoms, these may or may not be the cause of any back pain you're experiencing. please follow up with your doctor who can interpret these findings in the context of your symptoms and overall health."
N86,response_15,"your report essentially says:

1. the last fully formed disk space in your spine is labeled as l5-s1, which is quite normal and to be expected.
2. you do not have any sudden (acute) fractures or breaks, and the bodies of your vertebrae (the main, round part of the bones in your spine) are all intact.
3. you do not have a conspicuous slippage (listhesis) of the vertebrae (bones in your spine).
4. your lumbar spine leans slightly to the left, but this is minor.
5. there are changes (degenerative disc disease) in the l5-s1 disc - the very last disc in your lower back. this includes the development of gas within the disc space (""vacuum disc"") and hardening of the bone surrounding the disc (""discogenic sclerosis""). this often happens as we age. there are also similar, but milder changes in the remaining discs of your lower spine.
6. you have mild additional changes (arthropathy) in the face joints (connections between vertebrae). the most changes are at the l5-s1 level. this is also a common part of aging.
7. nothing else significant was found on your x-ray.

basically, you have some typical changes in your back that often occur as people age, especially in the lowest disc between the last lumbar and the first sacral vertebrae. none of these are particularly severe or problematic and no other important findings were noted."
N86,response_16,"here's a translation in simpler terms:

- the last fully formed disc space is designated as l5-s1: there is a designation system that doctors use to identify the different discs in your spine. the very last one in your lower back is being identified here as l5-s1.

- no acute fracture; intact vertebral body heights: there are no new (acute) fractures, and the bones of the spine (vertebrae) are of normal height.

- no significant listhesis: the bones of the spine are properly aligned on top of each other and none of them have slipped forward or backward significantly.

- minor lumbar levocurvature: there is a minor curve to the left side in the lower part of your spine.

- l5-s1 degenerative disc disease with vacuum disc and discogenic sclerosis, and milder degenerative disc space narrowing/endplate spurring at the remaining levels: there are some age-relation changes to the disc between the last two vertebrae. also, a 'vacuum disc' might refer to gas accumulation within the disc space due to degeneration. the 'discogenic sclerosis' refers to hardening of tissues because of the degeneration. similar, but less severe, changes are seen in the other discs of the lower spine too.

- mild facet arthropathy, greatest at l5-s1: the small joints on the backside of the vertebrae (facet joints), which are responsible for the spine's flexibility, have some mild age-related wear and tear changes. this is most notable at the l5-s1 joint.

- no other significant findings: there is nothing else major to report from the x-ray images.

overall, the study shows some normal age-related changes to the lowest part of your spine (the lumbar region); nothing that appears to be acute or serious in nature."
N86,response_17,"here is your report in simpler terms:

the report is about your lower back (lumbar spine) x-ray.

the first line is just establishing that they used the correct naming system for your backbones: the last fully formed disc space (cushion between your backbones) is the l5-s1. 

* there are no new or sudden bone breaks and the bones in your back are of a normal height.
* there's no significant misalignment or slippage of one vertebral bone over another (listhesis). there is minor curve to the left (levocurvature) in your lower back. 
* the disc (cushion) between your l5 and s1 backbones is wearing out (degenerative disc disease). this area also shows signs of 'vacuum disc' which is a sign of severe disc degeneration and 'discogenic sclerosis' which means the bone around the disc is getting harder and may be a response to the disc wearing down. the disc spaces at other levels are also showing mild signs of wear and tear.
* there is mild arthritis is in the facet joints (the joints that link the backbones together and allow them to move in relation to each other), most notably again at the l5-s1.
* no other important findings were found on the x-ray.

overall, this report describes some usual changes seen in the backbones and discs of the lower back with age and possibly with some extra wear and tear. keep in mind that while these changes can be associated with lower back pain, many people with similar x-ray findings have no pain at all. so, these findings need to be considered in the context of your symptoms and examination by your doctor."
N86,response_18,"your radiologist's report is indicating that you have a few age-related changes in your spine.

starting from the top:

\- the last fully formed disc space is designated as l5-s1: this is just a note about where the discs in your spine are labeled as l5-s1. they are labeling the last disc in your lower back. this is just standard language in an x-ray report.

\- no acute fracture; intact vertebral body heights: this means there are no recent breaks or fractures in your spine, and the bones (vertebrae) are of normal heights. 

\- no significant listhesis: this means there is no major misalignment in your spine.

\- minor lumbar levocurvature: this means there's a slight curve to the left in your lower back. this might be something you've had your whole life, or it could be due to muscle imbalances.

\- l5-s1 degenerative disc disease: this means the last disc in your lower back has signs of wear-and-tear. vacuum disc is a sign that there is a gap inside the disc, and discogenic sclerosis is a sign that the bone underneath the disc has hardened in response to the degenerating disc. both these things are common when there is a degenerating disc.

\- milder degenerative disc space narrowing/endplate spurring at the remaining levels: this means there is some slight thinning of the discs and bone spurs on the plates at the end of the vertebrae in other parts of your spine.

\- mild facet arthropathy, greatest at l5-s1: this means that the joints between your vertebrae (facet joints) show some slight signs of arthritis, mainly at the l5-s1 level.

\- no other significant findings: this means they didn't find anything else of note on the x-ray. 

overall, nothing on this report is particularly worrying. it's showing common changes that come with age. still, if you're experiencing back pain or other symptoms, you should discuss this with your healthcare provider to determine the best treatment options. it could involve physical therapy, lifestyle changes, or medications to manage any discomfort."
N86,response_19,"your x-ray report describes the condition of your lumbar spine, or lower back, which includes a sequence of five vertebral discs (l1-l5) from the ribs to the pelvis, and the s1 disc at the base of the spine.

here's what your report says in simpler terms:

- the last fully formed disc space is designated as l5-s1. this simply refers to the last disc in your lower back, right above your tailbone.
  
- you do not have any new fractures, and the height of your vertebral bodies or bones in your spine are normal.

- no significant listhesis. this means there's no abnormal alignment or slippage of your vertebras.

- minor lumbar levocurvature. this suggests a slight leftward curve of your lower spine.
  
- at the l5-s1 disc, there is degenerative disc disease with a vacuum disc and sclerosis. this means that the disc is wearing down, which may cause pain or discomfort. a vacuum disc refers to a condition where air gets trapped in the disc space. ""discogenic sclerosis"" means that the bone below this disc has hardened due to the stress of the degenerating disc.

- similar, but less severe changes (disc space narrowing and small bone spur formation) are seen in the other discs of your lower back. this is also related to wear and tear changes.

- there is also mild facet arthropathy, especially at l5-s1. this means there is slight wear and tear in the small joints at the back of your vertebrae, that allow your spine to bend and twist.

- there are no other significant findings, meaning there's nothing else the radiologist found unusual or of concern in your lumbar spine x-ray.

please remember to discuss this with your healthcare provider who can provide more personalized interpretation of these results based on your symptoms and physical examination. they can also suggest a treatment plan to manage the degenerative changes noted."
N86,response_20,"here's the breakdown in simpler terms:

- the report starts by confirming the last disc in your spine is l5-s1, which is normal.
- you haven't sustained a fresh break to any bones and the bodies of your vertebrae (the large, round part of each spinal bone) are still at their normal heights.
- you don't have any major cases of listhesis, which is slipping of the vertebrae. a minor curvature to the left (levocurvature) in your lower (lumbar) spine is noted, but this is usually not a serious concern unless it's extreme or causing symptoms.
- the disc at your l5-s1 level is showing signs of ageing or 'wear and tear' (degenerative disc disease). this is common as people age. the term ""vacuum disc"" refers to small air or gas collections that can occur within a disc when it degenerates. discogenic sclerosis is another aspect of the same degenerative process; it means the bone around the disc (endplates) is becoming a bit hard and thickened. it also notes that similar, but less severe, changes are seen at other levels of your spine.
- the facet joints in your spine, which are small stabilising joints between and behind adjacent vertebrae, show mild signs of 'wear and tear' as well (arthropathy), especially at the level of l5-s1. similar to disc degeneration, this is also a common finding as people age. 
- no other significant findings were discovered on the x-ray.

remember, these changes are common as we age and may not directly correlate with the symptoms, if you experience symptoms at all. it's important to discuss these results with your physician for treatment options and to understand their relevance to your personal health situation."
N86,response_21,"here's the simplified translation of your x-ray results:

the last fully formed disc space is designated as l5-s1.  
- the report is mentioning here how your lowermost back is being designated. l5-s1 represents the disc space between the 5th lumbar vertebra and 1st sacral vertebra (in the lowest part of your spine).

no acute fracture; intact vertebral body heights.  
- you don't have any signs of new (acute) fractures, and the heights of your spinal bones (vertebrae) are normal.

no significant listhesis. minor lumbar levocurvature.  
- listhesis is slippage of one vertebra on top of another. you don't have any significant slippage. however, you have a slight leftward curvature of the lower spine.

l5-s1 degenerative disc disease with vacuum disc and discogenic sclerosis, and milder degenerative disc space narrowing/endplate spurring at the remaining levels.  
- the disc at l5-s1, the lowest part of your spine, shows signs of wear-and-tear changes. the mention of a ""vacuum disc"" is likely referring to air found in disc space - often due to degeneration. discogenic sclerosis is calcification/hardening around that disc. also, there are mild signs of wear and tear in the remaining discs up the spine, seen as narrowing of the disc spaces and some bony protrusions (spurs).

mild facet arthropathy, greatest at l5-s1.  
- the facet joints, which are small joints at each segment of your spine that provide stability and help with certain movements, also show signs of arthritis (arthropathy), most notably at the level of l5-s1.

no other significant findings.
- nothing more of concern/diagnostic importance is found on this x-ray. 

so in simpler words, your report is showing wear and tear changes in your lower spine, which are most notable at the lowest disc (l5-s1). it includes a slight leftward curvature of your lower back. there are no new fractures or any other major findings. these changes can be common especially as we age and/or due to heavy physical activity/strains over time. please follow up with your doctor for the appropriate treatment and management plan."
N86,response_22,"sure, here's a simpler interpretation of the medical terms used in your report:

1. the last fully formed disc space is designated as l5-s1: the l5-s1 refers to the lumbar spine and the 1st bone of the sacrum. this is usually the last joint in your spine that carries weight. 

2. no acute fracture; intact vertebral body heights: you don't have any new or severe fractures, and the heights of your vertebral bodies (the bones creating your spinal column) are normal.

3. no significant listhesis. minor lumbar levocurvature: there's no great slippage/dislocation of a vertebra in reference to another. but there's a minor curvature towards the left in your lower back.

4. l5-s1 degenerative disc disease with vacuum disc and discogenic sclerosis, milder degenerative disc space narrowing/endplate spurring at remaining levels: the disc acting as a cushion between the 5th lumbar vertebra and first sacral vertebra has degenerated - this could be due to aging or wear and tear. vacuum disc indicates gas (generally nitrogen) accumulation in the disc space due to the degeneration. the discogenic sclerosis suggests hardening of the disc area. also, there's some narrowing of the spaces between your vertebrae, which is common with age, and some growth of bone spurs.

5. mild facet arthropathy, greatest at l5-s1: there's minor degeneration in the joints connecting your vertebrae (facet joints), most pronounced at l5-s1.

6. no other significant findings: they didn't find anything else worth noting. 

(note that this is a conservative translation from a medical professional, but symptoms, disease progression, and advice should always be consulted with a physician.)"
N86,response_23,"here's a simplified version of your report:

1. the last fully formed disc space is designated as l5-s1: your spine discs are often described by referencing the vertebrae they sit between. here, l5-s1 is referring to the disc between your fifth lumbar vertebrae and your first sacral vertebrae, this is the lowest spinal disc. 

2. no acute fracture; intact vertebral body heights: this means there are no recent bone breaks in your spine, and the height/size of your spinal bones is normal.

3. no significant listhesis. minor lumbar levocurvature: there is no significant slippage of vertebrae (listhesis) and you have a slight curvature to the left side (levocurvature) in your lower spine (lumbar).

4. l5-s1 degenerative disc disease with vacuum disc and discogenic sclerosis, and milder degenerative disc space narrowing/endplate spurring at the remaining levels: this means you're experiencing wear-and-tear damage (degenerative disc disease) at the l5-s1 spinal disc. this disc is also showing signs of being ""vacuum"" or having less cushioning material than normal, and hardened tissue or sclerosis, both of which are also signs of degeneration. the other spinal discs are showing less severe changes similar to this.

5. mild facet arthropathy, greatest at l5-s1: the facet joints, small joints at the back of your spine that help with flexibility and limiting certain movements, are showing mild signs of degeneration (arthropathy), especially around the l5-s1 area.

6. no other significant findings: apart from above-mentioned points, there are no other important findings.

remember this is not substitute for medical advice and you should consult with your healthcare provider directly to fully understand your condition."
N86,response_24,"here's your report explained in simple terms:

1. the last fully formed disc space is designated as l5-s1: this is just an anatomical reference point. each of our vertebrae, or backbones, are labelled, and l5-s1 is simply a name for the very bottom disc in your spine.

2. no acute fracture; intact vertebral body heights: there are no recently broken bones and the height of your backbones are within a normal range.

3. no significant listhesis. minor lumbar levocurvature: there's no significant slipping of one vertebra over another. the term 'levocurvature' means that your spine slightly curves to the left in the lower region, but this is considered minor.

4. l5-s1 degenerative disc disease with vacuum disc and discogenic sclerosis: this means that the disc between the lowest two vertebrae in your spine - l5 and s1 - is kind of worn out. ‘vacuum disc’ describes a gas-filled space in the disc that can happen with aging. discogenic sclerosis signifies some hardening of the disc.

5. milder degenerative disc space narrowing/endplate spurring at the remaining levels: the spaces between the other backbones are getting a little thinner which indicates ageing and wear and tear. some bony outgrowths (spurs) are seen on the flat ends (endplates) of the vertebral bones.

6. mild facet arthropathy, greatest at l5-s1: facets are the part of the vertebrae that help your spine move smoothly. 'arthropathy' means these facets are experiencing some wear and tear, mostly at l5-s1 level.

overall, your report suggests natural aging changes with a little more wear and tear at the lower part of your spine."
N86,response_25,"in layman's terms, here's what your report means:

- ""the last fully formed disc space is designated as l5-s1."" this is simply identifying the location of the last spinal disc in your lower back.

- ""no acute fracture; intact vertebral body heights."" you don't have any new fractures and the heights of your vertebral bodies, the main part of each bone in your spine (vertebra), are normal. 

- ""no significant listhesis. minor lumbar levocurvature."" there's no notable slipping of one vertebra over another one. you do, however, have a minor lean to the left in your lower spine, but minor deviations are relatively common and not usually problematic. 

- ""l5-s1 degenerative disc disease with vacuum disc and discogenic sclerosis, and milder degenerative disc space narrowing/endplate spurring at the remaining levels."" degenerative disc disease isn't really a ""disease"", but refers to the normal changes in your spinal discs as you age. in your case, the disc at the l5-s1 level in your spine is showing signs of wear. ""vacuum disc"" refers to gas (usually nitrogen) that has been sucked into the disc space, a sign of disc degeneration. ""discogenic sclerosis"" is a term for hardening of the disc tissue. you also show signs of discs at other levels wearing down, but not as much.

- ""mild facet arthropathy, greatest at l5-s1."" facets are small joints at each vertebral level that provide the spine with both stability and flexibility. ""arthropathy"" just means joint disease, so you have mild joint disease, most noticeably at l5-s1.

- ""no other significant findings."" there aren't any other important findings for you or your doctor to be concerned about right now. 

this x-ray of your lumbar spine essentially shows normal signs of aging and wear and tear in your lower back, with most of the changes at the bottom level, l5-s1.
  
  let me know if you have any question or you want me to explain something in more detail."
