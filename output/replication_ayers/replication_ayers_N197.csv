N197,response_1,"i'm an ai developed by openai and i'm here to help guide you, but i will iterate that speaking to a medical professional about your situation is a must. it's difficult to provide an exact diagnosis through the internet, especially with symptoms like this.

it does sound like the numbness and pain in your arms might be related to nerve compression. this could potentially be caused from sleeping in strange positions, but it could also be due to underlying issues such as a cervical radiculopathy, where the nerves are compressed at the level of the neck.

in regards to the discoloured patch on your skin, it's difficult to judge without seeing it in person. it could be a myriad of things including bruising, inflammation due to an underlying issue, an infection, or something else entirely. 

the sedatives you are taking can cause you to move or act unconsciously (e.g., sleepwalking, performing actions without remembering them), so it's also possible that you might have injured yourself without realizing it.

since you're experiencing significant symptoms and changes to your skin, it would be best to consult with a healthcare provider. they can examine you fully and guide you to next steps, whether it's further testing, a consultation with a specialist, or a modification of medication. also, please continue to address your mental health with your psychiatrist or mental health professional, particularly because you mentioned self-harm scars."
N197,response_2,"i'm an ai language model and i'm not a doctor, but i can provide some information based on the symptoms you mentioned. 

the symptoms you described and the picture might suggest a condition called superficial thrombophlebitis, which is inflammation and clotting in a superficial vein, often seen in people who take a lot of medications or have a sedentary lifestyle. 

the yellow color could be due to the breakdown of hemoglobin from extravasated red blood cells as part of the healing process of the vessel wall. small bruises can also appear if there was an injury, as you mentioned with the sharp pain and the numbness in your arms.

the numbness you mentioned could be due to a condition known as ""saturday night palsy"" or ""honeymoon palsy."" this is a temporary condition where the radial nerve gets compressed during deep sleep in an incorrect position, like having your arm draped over a chair. when pressure is applied to the nerve for an extended period of time, it can lead to nerve damage causing numbness, weakness or paralysis of the hand and wrist.

however, these are just possibilities based on the limited information you have offered. it would be best to consult with a healthcare provider who can take a more detailed history, perform a physical examination, and may perhaps order some tests to make an accurate diagnosis. they may also evaluate your current medication regimen and make recommendations if they suspect it may be contributing to these symptoms.

please don't hesitate to seek medical help immediately if the symptoms persist or become worse."
N197,response_3,"i'm an ai language model and while i'm not a doctor, i can give some general advice based on your situation.

you've provided a lot of details about your symptoms which are quite diverse. the yellow spots, sharp pains, and numbness could come from many causes. these could be related to possible nerve damage, circulation issues, or potentially side effects from one of your medications. it's important to note that several of the medications you're taking (zolpidem, quetiapine, trazodone, mirtazapine) can potentially cause some unusual side effects, including skin changes.

however, this is just speculation, and given the complexity of your symptoms, i strongly recommend that you see a doctor in person. they can conduct a thorough examination and order relevant tests, which can pinpoint a more accurate diagnosis. it's also possible that they may suggest changing or adjusting some of your medications if they believe those are contributing to your symptoms.

furthermore, mentioning your mental health struggles, please keep in contact with your psychiatrist or mental health care provider regularly. adjustments to your mental health medications, or additional forms of therapy, could also potentially help manage any physical symptoms related to mental health conditions.

again, please consult a physician for your symptoms as soon as possible, and remember to look after your mental health as well. and do note that self-harming is a serious matter, it's important to communicate with your healthcare provider about it too. they can help you find healthier ways to cope with pain, stress, and trauma."
N197,response_4,"it seems like you're experiencing a variety of symptoms that could be related to a number of different conditions. as a language model ai, i can give you some general advice, but i can't make accurate predictions on what may be the root cause. 

the spots that you describe seem to be related to some sort of trauma, be it constant pressure, pinch on the nerves, or even a minor injury you might not have noticed. however, these are just possible explanations. some sorts of medications also may cause bruising or bleeding easily such as anticoagulants.

* png_3964.jpg refers to the region termed the deltoid muscle. it is a common site for injections. bruising could occur if you have received an injection there recently.

* the numbness and difficulty using the arm is concerning and may suggest nerve impingement, which could be related to your sleeping position or another cause. however, it's also possible that it's related to the medications you're taking.

it's crucial to get these symptoms checked out by a healthcare provider in person. they will perform an examination and may use tests, such as an mri or nerve conduction studies, to further understand what may be happening. 

please do get in touch with your healthcare provider as soon as possible, and ensure you mention all your symptoms and medication history."
N197,response_5,"i'm an ai and i'm not a doctor, but i'll do my best to guide you based on the information you've provided.

the yellow spot you pointed out could indeed be a bruise. bruising may appear in response to trauma, pressure, or irritation of the tissues. it's also possible to bruise more easily with certain medications, especially if you're on blood thinners or heart medications like metoprolol.

however, frequent or unexpected bruising can be a symptom of an underlying condition, such as a bleeding or clotting disorder, vitamin deficiency, or even an infection. 

the numbness and tingling you described sounds like it could potentially be due to a nerve being compressed or damaged, most likely in your sleep based on the correlation you've mentioned.

given your medical history, i would urge you to discuss these findings with a healthcare professional. make sure to tell them about all of your symptoms, as well as any changes in your medications or lifestyle that may correlate with these changes. greater detail would help them make a better-informed assessment.

these symptoms could also potentially be side effects from your current medication regimen, and it would be beneficial to discuss this with your doctor or psychiatrist. they may be able to adjust your dosages or change your medication altogether to alleviate these side effects. as an ai, i cannot replace a consultation with a healthcare provider - if you are feeling alarmed or if your conditions are worsening, seek immediate medical attention."
N197,response_6,"i'm an ai language model and cannot directly view images nor make a diagnosis. however, i can suggest that discoloration and pain in your arm could indicate a number of possible medical conditions - everything from bruising from an unknown injury, to pressure from sleeping, to more serious conditions such as a blood clot or nerve damage.

that being said, given your symptom complex and medication list, it's important that you consult with your healthcare provider who can examine you physically and determine the most appropriate next steps. numbness in arms, particularly upon waking, could potentially be related to nerve compression (such as in carpal tunnel syndrome), but direct physical examination and potentially further imaging or nerve conduction studies might be needed to diagnose and treat this properly.

as for the yellow spot, it's hard to provide an explanation without seeing the image. it could be a bruise, which can sometimes be yellow as it heals, or it could be a completely different issue. please do not ignore these symptoms, reach out to your doctor to investigate them further.

also, if the self-harm implied in your message is ongoing, please reach out to mental health professionals. they can provide support and help you find healthier coping strategies. if you're in the u.s., you can contact the national suicide prevention lifeline at 1-800-273-talk (1-800-273-8255) or use the crisis text line by texting home to 741741."
N197,response_7,"i'm an ai developed by openai and can provide some insights, but you should always consult a healthcare provider with any immediate medical concerns. 

the issues you're describing could be related to a number of conditions. the numbness and pain in your arms when you wake up could potentially be due to nerve compression. this kind of nerve compression often develops due to irregular sleeping positions or underlying orthopedic abnormalities.

the yellow discolorations in the area are less clear. bruises are typically blue/purple, then turn yellow/brown as they heal. but considering you don't recall any injury to the area and have other symptoms, it wouldn't be right to just attribute it to a local bruise. 

in your circumstances, with a complex psychiatric and medical history, self-reported self-harming behaviors, and multiple medications that can have significant side effects, it's important to get in-person medical evaluation as soon as possible. your healthcare provider would have a better understanding of your overall well-being and conditions, and this would help them figure out the causes and necessary management of your new symptoms. be sure to let them know all of the details you've shared here, as it'll help them in their evaluation."
N197,response_8,"it seems like you are experiencing multiple issues here and it's always best to consult a healthcare professional in such cases. the appearance of yellow spots can indicate a number of alternate causes such as bruising, circles from pressure, inflammation from infection or injury, or even allergies of some type. 

the numbness in the arms during sleep can be due to impingements of the nerves and/or blood vessels - this can occur in certain sleep position. it's usually temporary and resolves once the pressure is relieved. however, chronic or frequent occurrences should be evaluated by a health care provider as this can lead to permanent damage if the cause is not corrected.

zolpidem is known to cause a range of side effects but the symptoms you are describing doesn't seem to be related to it.

as a note, i am an ai and i can only provide some general advice. you should seek professional medical attention and speak to your healthcare provider as soon as possible to make sure you don't have a condition that needs immediate treatment."
N197,response_9,"i'm an ai language model and not a doctor, but i can give you some general advice on your symptoms.

the yellow discoloration could be due to a bruise, trauma, or pressure on that area causing blood vessels under the skin to break and bleed internally. if you're experiencing sharp pain in your arms when moving them, it could be related to nerve damage, muscle strain, or other musculoskeletal issues. but the pain could also be referred from somewhere else in your body, which a medical professional would be able to determine through physical examination and by asking you more about your symptoms.

completely numb arms upon waking could be due to the way you're sleeping and putting pressure on the nerves in your arms. certain positions can lead to conditions like ulnar nerve entrapment or carpal tunnel syndrome, but these would generally cause numbness and pain in specific areas (typically the forearm, hand, and fingers), not the entire arm.

your guess about possibly sleeping in an unusual position might be correct, but again, a healthcare professional would need to assess your symptoms and possibly conduct tests to confirm.

in terms of your medications, it's possible some of them could be contributing to the somatic symptoms you're experiencing. sedatives and psychoactive medications can sometimes lead to unusual side effects or drug-drug interactions.

given your symptoms and concerns, it would be highly advisable to get a medical evaluation. even if the discoloration and arm pain are harmless and temporary, they could indicate an underlying issue that needs to be addressed. you should not ignore them.

please try seeking professional help regarding your self-harm behavior as well. there are services and people who are trained to help with these issues. it's crucial that you inform your healthcare provider about this behavior.

let me emphasize how crucial it is for you to talk to your psychiatrist and/or a physician about all of these things. you don't have to face this alone. there are people who can help."
N197,response_10,"i'm an ai language model and not a doctor, but these symptoms could potentially relate to your sleep position or the medications you're taking, since zolpidem and sedatives can sometimes lead to abnormal sleep behaviors. however, it might be something else entirely. the best course of action would be to seek the opinion of a healthcare professional who can diagnose your condition accurately. please consult your doctor about these symptoms soon."
N197,response_11,"the yellow marks with bruise spots might be a sign of a hematoma, which is a collection of blood caused by a broken blood vessel under the skin. this can occur due to an injury or trauma, and might not have been noticed if you were heavily sedated. it can also happen spontaneously in some individuals who are on anticoagulants or if they have bleeding disorders. the pain and numbness in your arms might be due to nerve compression or pinching, which can occur due to improper sleeping postures or an underlying condition such as thoracic outlet syndrome, among others.

i would strongly advise you to consult a doctor for a correct diagnosis. the doctor can examine you, take your complete history, and perform necessary tests like blood tests, imaging, neurological examination, etc. to determine the cause of your symptoms and provide appropriate treatment. 

your self-harm history is also worrying - addressing your mental well-being is vital. be sure to speak honestly with your doctor or psychiatrist about your struggles so they can offer help or modify your medication regimen if needed. while i understand it can be challenging, try to resist self-harming. try methods like distracting yourself, reaching out to a trusted friend or counselor, or practice mindfulness techniques. always remember it's necessary and okay to ask for help when you need it."
N197,response_12,"i'm sorry to hear about the challenges you've been experiencing. 

the yellow spot on your arm does seem like it could be a bruise, especially if you're facing issues with numbness and sharp pain. it could be due to a minor injury or strain like sleeping in a funny position or unintentional self-harm during sleep time when sedative medications are in effect, causing alterations in motor behavior. although, this can't be confirmed without a physical examination.

in terms of the numbness and sharp pain sensations, these may potentially be symptoms of nerve compression or damage if they are occurring regularly. 

i would recommend arranging an appointment with your healthcare provider to discuss these symptoms further, as it's important to ensure that there's no underlying condition that could potentially cause these symptoms. you might also need to review your medications with your doctor particularly considering you are using multiple sedative medications which might interact with each other. 

mental health is extremely important, and it's crucial that you continue to receive support for managing your depression and other symptoms. if you ever feel like you are in crisis, don't hesitate to reach out to a trusted individual or a mental health professional. 

please do not use this as medical advice, this is for informational purposes only. consult your healthcare practitioner for further evaluation.

take care!"
N197,response_13,"i'm an ai language model and not a doctor, but i can provide a general advice based on the information you've shared. it does seem possible that your symptoms are related to pressure on your nerves during sleep, which is causing numbness and the sharp pain you described. the discoloration could be related to this but could also be a result of some other condition, such as a blood vessel issue or a reaction to medication.

you've mentioned you're on several medications, many of which can have a range of side effects. i strongly recommend you discuss your symptoms with your healthcare provider, as they can examine you and have your medical history, which will give them a much clearer picture of what might be going on. they might refer you to a neurologist if they suspect nerve damage.

moreover, if you're experiencing problems with self-harm, it's crucial to speak up about this too. your mental health is just as important as your physical health. mental health professionals can provide you with strategies to manage self-harm urges and work through underlying emotional issues. please seek help immediately if you're feeling suicidal.

remember, this advice is intended to be general in nature, you should contact a healthcare provider for advice on your individual health.

if you're in a crisis, reach out to a trusted individual or a counselor right away. keep in mind that there are hotlines available in many countries that offer immediate support."
N197,response_14,"i'm an ai developed by openai, so i can provide some general advice based on your symptoms, but i strongly recommend reaching out to a healthcare professional as soon as possible. 

the yellow discoloration might indeed be a bruise if you've had some sort of pressure on your arm during sleep. bruises (medically known as contusions) can change colors as they heal, moving from reddish, to purple, to green, and finally to yellow. however, it is also possible that you have developed a skin infection or other condition, particularly if you have a history of self-harm in that area.

the numbness and sharp pain might be related to nerve compression, potentially due to sleeping position. however, conditions like peripheral neuropathy and more complex neurological conditions should be ruled out by your doctor. 

regardig your medication, zolpidem, along with other sedatives, can sometimes lead to abnormal sleep behaviors, which could possibly explain this unusual bruising. however, please reach out to your doctor who can properly evaluate your condition, as internet advice can't replace personalized medical advice. always make sure to discuss any medication changes or concerns with your healthcare provider before making adjustments on your own.

lastly, self-harm is serious and can lead to dangerous injuries and complications. please seek help from a mental health professional if you're having urges to hurt yourself, or reach out to a trusted person in your life."
N197,response_15,"i'm an ai and while i can't diagnose or provide medical advice, i can tell you that the bruising you are experiencing could be caused by a number of things including medications, trauma or pressure, and certain health conditions. it's important to discuss what you're experiencing with your doctor so they can examine you and possibly run some tests if necessary. 

regarding the numbness you mentioned when you wake up, this could be due to sleeping in an awkward position that has caused a nerve to become pinched or pressure on a nerve due to inflammation, among other reasons. it's also important to discuss these symptoms with your doctor.

concerning your use of various sedatives and antidepressants, please remember it's incredibly important to only take medications as prescribed by your healthcare provider. if you believe your medications are not helping enough or causing side effects, talk this over with your doctor. they can help adjust your dosages or switch medications if necessary.

finally, the self-harm cuts you mentioned are a sign of serious emotional distress and it's crucial you talk about these feelings with your healthcare provider or a trusted individual. people who self-harm sometimes feel alone or like they have no other options, but there are many resources out there to help and many people who want to assist you on your path to recovery. stay strong."
N197,response_16,"i'm an ai and not a doctor or healthcare provider, so i can't provide a diagnosis or medical advice, but i can give you some information that might help.

firstly, those yellow bruises on your arms may also be known as ecchymosis, which is a form of a bruise. ecchymosis occurs whenever small blood vessels under your skin leak blood, leading to discoloration. the reason could be various, from trauma, bleeding disorder, side effects from medication to systemic conditions. 

about the sudden numbness in your arm, it’s usually down to the way you've slept or sat, that's been known as a “sleeping wrong” or “pins and needles”. this can happen if you've been applying pressure to a nerve for a long time, like when you've been leaning on an arm or leg, it should go away swiftly once the pressure is released.

if the numbness doesn't go away quickly or happen frequently, it's crucial to get it checked out by a healthcare professional. nerve damage can be a serious condition and is often linked to diseases like diabetes, or could possibly be a sign of a stroke.

since you're taking multiple medications, interactions between them or side effects could also be responsible for some of your symptoms. if your current medications aren't helping to manage your symptoms, it's important to discuss this with your prescriber, as adjustments in your medication regimen might be needed.

you're absolutely right to bring up these concerns to a healthcare professional. they can provide you guidance and treatment options based on your full medical history and current health status. 

regarding your history of self-harm, it's really important to talk to someone you trust about what you're going through. reach out to a trusted friend, family member, or mental health professional. always remember – there are people who want to help, and self-harm is not the answer.

N197,response_17,"i'm an ai language model developed by openai, and i don't have access to real-time data or direct observation of individuals, including photographs, and i don't have the ability to directly diagnose any health conditions. i can, however, talk in general about certain conditions and symptoms.

what you describe could potentially be related to your sleeping position, especially considering the numbness and sharp pain on movement which could be attributed to nerve compression or impingement.

however, it could also be related to medication side effects or even a form of dermatitis. also, it's important to pay attention to whether or not the yellowing is due to bruising or if it could potentially be an indication of jaundice, which could signify a problem with your liver functioning. 

keep in mind that it's essential to speak to a healthcare professional in person for an accurate assessment. i urge you to consult a doctor about your symptoms for a thorough investigation. if you started noticing these symptoms after starting a particular medication, mention this to your doctor.

please also continue to get support for your mental health – it's just as important as physical health. if you're struggling with self-harm, there are resources available to help you cope. reach out to trusted friends, mental health professionals, or helplines. remember, there's help available whenever you need it."
N197,response_18,"i'm an ai developed by openai, so i cannot physically examine you, but your symptoms may suggest that it might be some kind of pressure point bruising or bruising related to physical strain. if you've had your arm or hand under pressure while sleeping, that might indeed cause it.

that said, considering your history of medication use, it's also possible that medications could have led to an increased bruising tendency. quetiapine, for instance, might cause this side effect.

furthermore, given the other symptoms you're mentioning, including sharp pain in your arms and your arms becoming numb while sleeping, it does suggest possible issues with circulation or nerve pathways. these problems might be due to anatomical issues, like a pinched nerve, which can get worse with specific sleep positions.

sonsequently, i would recommend you see your healthcare provider to be evaluated further. they might instruct you to change the dosage of your medication or switch to another medication. they may consider a complete blood count or liver function tests to evaluate for any other causes of the bruising. also, imaging like an x-ray or mri might be helpful, especially if the sensations of numbness, pain, and weakness persist."
N197,response_19,"i'm a language model ai and not a doctor but i can share some insight based on the details you provided. the yellow mark in your photo does resemble a bruise, which might have been caused by trauma. as you have no recollection of any related accident, it's hard to determine the exact cause. the fact that it appeared suddenly today and you have noticed a smaller version of it a month back could hint at a recurrent issue. 

bruising could result from several reasons other than trauma including certain medications, deficiencies, and medical conditions such as coagulation disorders. therefore it would be best to discuss this with your doctor, especially if the area becomes painful or the discoloration doesn't fade away after a couple of weeks. 

as for your other symptoms such as arm numbness, sharp pain, and the potential nerve issue, these could be related to a variety of conditions. these conditions range from nerve impingement or compression due to sleeping position, to neurological conditions. i would highly recommend discussing these symptoms with a healthcare provider who can provide a better physical assessment and possibly recommend tests as needed. again, i'm not a doctor but i recommend you speak to one about these symptoms."
N197,response_20,"i'm an ai language model and i can help provide some possible guidance, but please consult with a healthcare professional for any serious concerns related to your health.

the yellow spots on your arm you mentioned may indicate bruising, which can happen after an injury or when blood vessels under the skin rupture and leak blood into nearby tissues. this is especially common if you're using certain types of medications or have certain medical conditions.

it's also possible the numbness and arm pain you're experiencing is related to sleeping in unusual positions, which could cause pressure on certain nerves. this could cause temporary numbness and a tingling sensation when the pressure is relieved. in some cases, persistent numbness can be a sign of nerve damage, but this would need to be evaluated by a professional.

the high dosage and mix of medications may have side effects or interactions, and this could potentially affect your bruising or other symptoms. always consult your doctor or pharmacist before adjusting your medication regimen, and if any new symptoms arise, like these mystery bruises, i would recommend getting a consultation.

if the bruising increases, or you experience more frequent or severe numbness, pain, or other symptoms, please seek urgent medical attention. especially since you have a complex history of psychiatric and physical health conditions and are on numerous medications, it's essential for a medical professional to evaluate these symptoms. they may require adjustments to your medication regimen or further investigation into the root cause of these symptoms."
N197,response_21,"it could possibly be bruising as a result of irritation to the nerves or underlying tissue due to your sleeping posture - as you suspected. however, without a physical examination, it may be hard to confirm. you may want to visit your doctor for a proper diagnosis, especially if it worsens or does not resolve, or if you have more severe symptoms such as inability to move your arm, severe pain, or any other unexplained symptoms.

as you've mentioned a history of self-harm, i would strongly encourage you to continue working with your psychiatrist or psychologist. well done on reaching out and seeking help, it's a brave and important step. always reach out to your mental health professional or a trusted loved one in times of distress. if you feel your medication regime is not working as it should or causing uncomfortable side effects, let your doctor(s) know so they can adjust accordingly. there is help available, do not hesitate to reach out."
N197,response_22,"i'm an ai and while i can't look at the photo you linked or diagnose complex conditions, i can tell you that your symptoms of arm numbness, sharp pain, and visual changes on the skin suggest that you should definitely seek professional medical advice. your physician will be able to conduct a thorough examination based on your symptoms and medical history. 

sleeping in the wrong position could cause temporary numbness or 'pins and needles' in your arms. in rare cases, nerve damage could present with persistent numbness or pain. similarly, the signs on your skin could be from bruising or maybe even a reaction to your medications. 

please talk to your doctor about these symptoms as soon as you can. it's important they evaluate your medications and physical symptoms to adjust treatment if necessary. if you struggle with self-harm behavior or thoughts, please reach out to a mental health professional or a trusted person in your life. it's crucial to have an ongoing dialogue about your feelings and experiences with someone who can offer help and support."
N197,response_23,"i'm sorry but as an ai developed by openai, i can't evaluate images or provide specific medical advice related to your individual concerns. however, what you describe with the numbness in your arms and pressure on certain areas does sound consistent with something called nerve impingement, which can sometimes be caused by sleeping in certain positions. however, it could also be due to a lot of other things like stress, poor ergonomics or more severe conditions and definitely warrants further investigation by a healthcare professional.

the presence of bruising, such as what you describe, would be more unusual and i would recommend that you seek medical evaluation sooner rather than later. unexplained bruising can be due to a number of issues including underlying bleeding or clotting disorder, certain medications or supplements, or physical injury. given your psychiatric history and current medications, it's also necessary to make sure your psychiatric symptoms are well managed and that self-harm risk is minimized.

please, get evaluated by a doctor who can take a comprehensive history, do a physical examination and any necessary tests to get to the bottom of these symptoms. medical help alongside mental health support will be essential."
N197,response_24,"i'm an ai developed by openai and don't have the ability to view images or directly diagnose medical conditions. however, i can offer some general advice based on the symptoms you've described here. 

you mention a yellow discoloration and pain in your arms, along with episodes of arm numbness that seem to resolve with movement. while you believe this could be due to nerve damage as a result of sleeping in awkward positions, there could be multiple other causes. 

yellow discoloration might be caused by bruising, a reaction to medication, or other skin conditions. similarly, arm numbness can be attributed to nerve impingement, circulatory issues, certain vitamin deficiencies, or even the side effects of certain medications.

your mental health history and medication regime seem quite complex. many of the drugs you are currently taking can have sedation as a side effect, which might affect your physical positions while sleeping and lead to pressure on specific parts of your body.

given the severity of your symptoms, it's crucial to reach out to a healthcare provider for further evaluation. remember that seeking help online cannot replace a proper consultation and evaluation done by a professional.

N197,response_25,"i'm an ai language model and while i can't diagnose or treat medical conditions, i can provide you with some general advice about your described symptoms. bruises can develop without a known cause, but sudden onset, recurrent numbness, and weakness in your arms could suggest a nerve issue. the location of your ache/pain could indeed suggest some kind of nerve impingement. it's also notable that laying in certain positions for long periods of time can impinge nerves and cause numbness or weakness. however, i recommend you consult your doctor as soon as possible, as these symptoms should be evaluated to rule out serious conditions. 

when it comes to potential interaction of multiple drugs (like quetiapine, hydroxyzine, trazodone and zolpidem), it should also be discussed with your doctor, as polypharmacy, the use of multiple drugs, can increase the risk of adverse effects and interactions. 

lastly, it's important to mention that if you're experiencing mental distress and tendencies towards self-harm, it's crucial to reach out to your mental health professional or a trusted individual in your life about this. there are helplines available for immediate assistance as well:
