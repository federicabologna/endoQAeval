N76,response_1,"i'm an ai, not a doctor, but here's some general advice that might help! it's generally good not to jump to conclusions before talking to your doctor about your medical test results, although it is natural to worry when something seems out of the ordinary. lymph nodes can become enlarged for various reasons, including infections, immune responses, and less commonly, cancer. a lymph node measuring 17mm is larger than normal, but it doesn't necessarily mean it's concerning. the fact that your report said it was ""normal appearing"" is a positive sign. your doctor will be able to provide more context and interpret the results accurately. if you're feeling anxious, you may want to call and ask if they can discuss your results sooner."
N76,response_2,"a 17mm lymph node in the neck is somewhat large, so it's understandable that you're concerned. however, keep in mind that lymph nodes can enlarge for many reasons. an enlarged, painless lymph node can be a reaction of the immune system to a minor infection, an allergic reaction or it can be related to more serious conditions such as lymphoma. if your report indicated that it appeared normal, it's likely not something immediate to worry about. however, since it's been present for 2.5 years, further investigation by a medical professional might be necessary. additionally, your ongoing exhaustion could be due to various factors and may not necessarily relate to this lymph node. it's essential to discuss this with your healthcare provider soon - make sure to mention all your symptoms and any concerns about them."
N76,response_3,"i'm an ai language model and while i can't replace a doctor's advice, i can tell you a little bit about lymph nodes. normally, lymph nodes are small and can sometimes be felt under the skin. when they are inflamed, they can grow larger and become noticeable and/or palpable. lymph nodes larger than 1 cm (or 10mm) are generally considered abnormal in some locations but not necessarily in others, like the neck where lymph nodes can be larger. however, a persistent lymph node that is growing definitely warrants a conversation with your healthcare provider. your constant tiredness could be due to many factors, but if it is related to the enlarged lymph node, it could indicate an infection, an autoimmune condition, or in rare cases, a malignancy. 

continue to monitor your symptoms and definitely follow up with your doctor once they are available. the ultrasound report saying ""normal appearing"" is a good sign, but given the size and your symptoms, further evaluation may be necessary. the important part is to have open communication with your doctor, discuss your concerns thoroughly, and ask for any necessary tests. please remember to always consult with your healthcare provider for any health-related concerns."
N76,response_4,"iâ€™m an ai and cannot make medical judgments or diagnose conditions, but i can tell you that lymph nodes, small glands that filter lymph fluid, can become enlarged for a number of reasons, including infection, inflammation, or cancer. although it's unusual for a lymph node to remain enlarged for years, in most cases an enlarged lymph node is not a sign of a serious problem. given that your neck lymph node is ""normal appearing"" according to your report, the best thing to do is to remain calm, maintain a healthy lifestyle, and wait to speak with your doctor about it. if you are experiencing persistent fatigue, it's also important to discuss this with your doctor as it may be the symptom of some underlying condition. make sure to share all relevant information about your health for an accurate diagnosis."
N76,response_5,"i'm an ai developed by openai and i'm not a doctor, but i can say that lymph nodes can swell or enlarge due to various reasons like infections, immune diseases, or in rare cases, cancers. if a lymph node has been enlarged for a longer period without any apparent reason, it's typically advised to seek medical advice and further diagnostic procedures, such as the ultrasound you have had. fatigue can be caused by a variety of conditions - it's not necessarily linked to your lymph node. 17 mm is a bit larger than what physicians normally feel in a physical exam but, as mentioned, enlargement can be caused by a variety of factors. the report, however, states it has a ""normal"" appearance which is good. nonetheless, please do not substitute this reply for a professional opinion. make sure to discuss your symptoms, concerns, and the findings with your doctor once they have the full results."
N76,response_6,"i'm an artificial intelligence and cannot provide personal diagnosis. but, it's important not to jump to conclusions prematurely. it's understandable though to feel concerned. in general, lymph nodes are part of your immune system and can swell for a variety of reasons, like infection, injury, or illness. lymph nodes larger than 1 cm (10 mm) are generally considered abnormal, but that doesn't automatically mean something serious. the chronic fatigue you describe could be caused by numerous conditions unrelated to your lymph nodes, sometimes even lifestyle factors such as poor sleep or stress may cause it. your doctor will have a much better understanding of what might be going on based on your full medical history and the full results of your ultrasound. it's great that you've already been proactive about your health. please wait for your doctor's advice and guidance."
N76,response_7,"i'm an artificial intelligence and not a doctor, but i can tell you generally, lymph nodes can enlarge due to a variety of reasons, including infection, inflammation, or in rare cases, malignancies. 17mm is larger than normal for a lymph node, but without more information, it's impossible to say if it's of concern. you mentioned your report said the node is ""normal appearing,"" which is a good sign. 

however, if you're experiencing systemic symptoms consistently like fatigue, it would be good to discuss these symptoms with your doctor. please get in touch with a healthcare professional who can discuss the results more accurately with you and possibly order more tests if necessary.

remember, it's important to get a professional, medical opinion. always consult with a healthcare provider for any health concerns."
N76,response_8,"i'm an ai language model and not a doctor, but i can share some general information with you. lymph nodes can be enlarged for many reasons, and not all are cause for concern. infections or immune responses, for example, can cause lymph nodes to enlarge temporarily. however, persistent enlargement, especially accompanied by other symptoms, should be evaluated by a doctor. in your case, the constant fatigue is something you should discuss with your doctor as well. the term ""normal appearing"" usually means that to the radiologist the lymph node did not have the classic characteristics of a lymph node that is concerning, which is generally a good sign. however, you should definitely wait and talk to your doctor for their interpretation of the report and further guidance."
N76,response_9,"enlarged lymph nodes can be a sign of infection, immune disease, or cancer. however, they can also just be a normal variant. there isn't a specific size at which a lymph node is considered abnormal or concerning. in general, lymph nodes larger than 1 cm can be considered enlarged. 

for most people, lymph nodes less than 2 cm (e.g., your 17 mm node) are not a cause for concern, particularly if they are soft, mobile, and not growing rapidly. however, lymph nodes that are hard, fixed in place, rapidly growing, or associated with other concerning symptoms can sometimes indicate cancer.

given the location of your lymph node and your fatigue, it may be worth discussing with your doctor whether a biopsy of the lymph node is indicated. it's also a good idea to have a comprehensive physical examination and blood work.

while it can be hard not to stress over health concerns, try to remind yourself that you are taking all the right steps to take care of your health by getting the ultrasound and discussing your results with your doctor. try to stay calm and wait for your doctor's feedback rather than self-diagnosing."
N76,response_10,"i'm an ai language model, not a doctor, but i can tell you that different factors can cause swollen lymph nodes, including infection and auto-immune diseases, and they could also be associated with conditions like lymphoma. it's good to stay in communication with your doctor, and remember, even though the waiting can be stressful, it doesn't automatically mean bad news. your symptoms could also potentially be related to something like chronic fatigue syndrome or to anemia. don't panic until you have more precise information about your health condition. keep your dialogue open with your healthcare providers."
N76,response_11,"i'm an ai language model and can't be a substitute for a real doctor's advice but i can provide some general insight. 

lymph nodes are part of the immune system and can become enlarged (swollen) in response to infections or diseases. it's fairly common for them to be palpable, particularly in certain areas like the neck. 

a size of 17mm for a lymph node is generally larger than what's typically seen, but it doesn't automatically indicate something serious like cancer. other factors to consider include its characteristics (hard, soft, movable, etc.), whether it's causing pain, and other symptoms you may be experiencing. 

your constant tiredness may or may not be related. if it's significantly impacting your quality of life, it warrants further investigation.

in short, while the size of the lymph node and your symptoms might be a cause for concern, it's important not to jump to conclusions before speaking to your doctor. only a healthcare professional can properly interpret your results in the context of your overall health history."
N76,response_12,"i'm an ai language model and not a doctor, however, i can tell you that lymph nodes in the neck often enlarge in response to infections, inflammation, or other issues. sometimes, they can remain swollen even after the initial problem has resolved. however, a persistent enlarged lymph node over a long period could also indicate other conditions such as certain infections that aren't resolving on their own, autoimmune diseases, or rarely, types of cancer. 

your symptoms of fatigue could be related or could be due to many other factors. it's good that you're getting it evaluated by your physician.

importantly, an ultrasound typically cannot diagnose a condition. it can provide information about the shape, size, location and other characteristics of the lymph node, but a definitive diagnosis often requires further tests. 

the term ""normal appearing"" suggests that the node doesn't have abnormalities that are typically associated with certain conditions, but it doesn't rule anything out. you should discuss your results and ongoing symptoms with your doctor. they might suggest a wait-and-see approach, additional tests or refer you to a specialist. in the meantime, try not to get too stressed, as that won't help your situation."
N76,response_13,"i'm an ai language model and not a doctor, but i can provide some general advice based on medical knowledge. 

in general, most lymph nodes are small, usually less than 1 cm (10 mm) in diameter. however, the size of lymph nodes can vary depending on the location and individual. there are benign reasons lymph nodes can enlarge, such as infections, inflammations or injury. 

nevertheless, a lymph node of 17 mm in the neck, especially one that has increased in size over a period of time, is significant and should be evaluated further. chronic fatigue can be a symptom of various conditions, so investigations may be necessary. 

the ultimate interpretation of an ultrasound report is done by the doctor who knows your clinical history best. it may not necessarily mean something serious even if the size is large, but it's important to follow up with your doctor for a correct interpretation. it's always better to get a professional opinion in these cases. be sure to express your worries when speaking with your doctor, so they can address them directly. 

this advice is general in nature, and it's best to consult your doctor for accurate information. please don't panic and wait for your doctor's advice."
N76,response_14,"while it's always important to listen to your body and be vigilant about any changes, long standing unchanged lymph nodes are not typically concerning. lymph nodes can be enlarged or palpable for a variety of reasons, including past infections or inflammation, so a single 17mm lymph node in your neck is not necessarily alarming. of note is that it's described as ""normal appearing"", which is generally a good sign.

your tiredness may be due to a number of reasons, including stress, poor sleep, diet, low iron, hypothyroidism or any number of other relatively benign conditions. if that continues, it'd be good to discuss with a doctor. it's also worth noting that anxiety or worry over your health can contribute significantly to feelings of fatigue.

your healthcare provider can provide more specific information based on your individual health and the other physical findings. let them know about your extreme fatigue as well. you're doing the right thing by getting it checked out and following up with your healthcare provider is the best next step."
N76,response_15,"i'm an ai language model and i can't directly evaluate your health situation, but i can give general advice.

lymph nodes often swell in response to infection or diseases. a node is generally considered enlarged if it's over 1.0 cm in diameter (some sources say 1.5 cm for nodes in certain areas or in older patients). so, a 17mm node is larger than the usual threshold, but this does not automatically signify cancer or other serious diseases.

being always tired is not specific and can occur in many conditions like anemia, thyroid disorders, infections, or simply stress. but in combination with enlarged lymph nodes, testing might be needed.

in terms of next steps, it's important to follow up with your healthcare provider to interpret the results of your tests in context of your history and physical exam. your symptoms have been there for a long time, so waiting until mid next week for your doctor's interpretation is reasonable until you hear otherwise.

i would also suggest discussing your concerns openly with your healthcare provider. even though waiting for results can be anxiety-provoking, remember that healthcare providers are trained to interpret these results appropriately.

if your symptoms worsen or you develop new ones, seek immediate medical attention."
N76,response_16,"while a 17mm lymph node is larger than normal (normal is usually considered anything up to 1cm, or 10mm), it doesn't automatically indicate a serious condition. lymph nodes can enlarge due to various reasons, including infection and inflammation. persistent fatigue is a nonspecific symptom that can be related to many conditions, not necessarily linked to the lymph node. 

however, given that your lymph node has been present and growing for a considerable amount of time, it's important to ensure this isn't a sign of something more worrisome like lymphoma. the fact that the report said it was ""normal appearing"" though is generally a good sign.

ultimately, you'll need to talk to your doctor to interpret these results in the context of your overall health and possibly other tests. it's fully understandable to be anxious - but in the meantime try not to worry excessively. please follow up with your doctor as soon as you can for a proper evaluation."
N76,response_17,"i'm an ai language model and not a doctor, but i can provide some general information that might help. normal-sized lymph nodes are usually less than 1 cm (10 mm) in diameter. in general, lymph nodes larger than 1 cm can be a sign of an infection or, in some cases, cancer. the fact that your lymph node has been present for a long time and that it seems to have grown could potentially be concerning. 

however, your report said it is ""normal appearing"", which suggests that the radiologist didn't see any signs of something dangerous. furthermore, while 17 mm lymph node is larger than normal, there are non-harmful causes that could explain this, such as an infection or an immune response.

if you're feeling constant fatigue, there could be many reasons for this. it could be related to your lymph node, but it could also be due to a number of other factors like stress, diet, lack of exercise, or certain health conditions. 

your doctor is the best person to discuss all of this with. it's good that you've had an ultrasound and are in touch with your healthcare provider about this. follow-up with them, express your concerns and don't hesitate to ask questions. until then, try to relax and avoid jumping to negative conclusions based on this information alone."
N76,response_18,"enlarged lymph nodes can be concerning but they do not always mean that there is a serious illness. lymph nodes can become enlarged for a variety of reasons, such as infections, autoimmune diseases, or cancer. a lymph node that is 17mm is larger than normal but still within the range that can be seen with benign (non-cancerous) conditions. 

however, the fact that you are consistently tired is something that should be explored. there are numerous causes of fatigue, some of which are easily treated with lifestyle changes while others require medical intervention. 

it's good that you have had an ultrasound done, but further testing may be required to figure out the cause. it could be as simple as you fighting off a viral infection, or it could be an indication of something more serious like lymphoma or another type of cancer. your doctor will know how best to interpret the results in the context of your other symptoms and health history. in the meantime, take a deep breath and try not to jump to conclusions or worst-case scenarios. it's normal to be worried when faced with uncertainty, but remember that feeling tired can also be due to anxiety or stress. 

again, it's good you've sought medical attention and it's key to stay communicative and honest with your physician about all your symptoms."
N76,response_19,"i'm an ai language model developed by openai and i can provide some general information for you, but it's important to remember that you should always consult your healthcare provider for medical advice. 

lymph nodes can be larger than normal for a variety of reasons, such as inflammation, infection, or illness. lymph nodes are part of your body's immune system and help your body recognize and fight off foreign invaders. 

a lymph node size of 17mm is larger than what is typically considered normal, but size isn't the only important factor. other factors, such as consistency (you described it as rock hard), changes in size, and associated symptoms are also important. your history of this node being present for 2.5 years and your extreme fatigue are notable. fatigue can be a sign of many conditions, both minor and serious, so further investigations may be necessary.

the term ""normal appearing"" in the report is usually reassuring as it indicates that the node's structural characteristics seen on imaging do not suggest a worrying cause such as malignancy. 

however, given your symptoms and concern, you should definitely discuss these findings in more detail with your healthcare provider. remember that while waiting for your results, it's best to avoid trying to self-diagnose since it often leads to unnecessary worry."
N76,response_20,"i'm an ai and can't replace advice from a medical professional, but i can tell you that lymph nodes can sometimes enlarge due to infection, inflammation or in some cases, malignancies. however, prolonged enlargement and your other symptoms might warrant further investigation. dealing with healthcare matters can be scary. just remember: even if it turns out to be serious, many conditions are treatable, especially when caught early. you did the right thing by getting it checked out. although it's easier said than done, try not to worry too much until you hear back from the doctor."
N76,response_21,"i'm an ai and unable to diagnose medical conditions, but i can help by providing general information. lymph nodes can swell for a variety of reasons, such as infections, inflammation, or in rare cases, cancers. a lymph node size of 17mm on the larger side, but not necessarily indicative of a serious condition. the fact that the report says ""normal appearing"" is a good sign, but it's very important to follow up with your healthcare provider to discuss the findings. your fatigue and the growth of the node over time are things that should be mentioned to your doctor as well. as always, it's best to push for more tests if you're not feeling well or if something seems unusual with your health. remember this is only general advice and can't substitute a proper medical consultation."
N76,response_22,"i'm an ai language model and don't have access to personal health records, but generally speaking, lymph nodes can become enlarged due to several reasons such as infections, autoimmune diseases, or cancers. a size of 17 mm is usually considered enlarged, but it doesn't automatically mean there's a serious problem, especially if it's ""normal appearing."" the fact it's been there for a while and you're only symptom is tiredness (which could be due to many reasons), might suggest a less alarming cause. however, only a doctor can accurately interpret these findings taking all of your medical history and symptoms into account. i'd recommend waiting for your doctor to discuss the results with you. it's important not to stress or worry too much as this might worsen your feelings of tiredness."
N76,response_23,"i'm an ai language model and not a doctor but i can provide some general guidance. it's understandable that you're feeling anxious about your test results. lymph nodes can become enlarged for a variety of reasons, including infection or inflammation. a 17mm lymph node in the neck could indeed be larger than normal but the exact concern it presents depends on the context. if your doctor told you it is ""normal appearing,"" it suggests that it doesn't have the characteristics typically associated with more serious conditions like cancer. your chronic fatigue is a symptom that could be due to many things, including various lifestyle factors or health conditions. you should definitely take your questions and concerns to your healthcare provider and get a formal medical opinion. ensure you also discuss your symptoms like unexplained fatigue and the presence of multiple enlarged lymph nodes. they would be able to provide the right advice based on your full medical history and circumstances."
N76,response_24,"lymph nodes, small glands that produce white blood cells to fight infection, can become enlarged due to inflammation, infection, or even cancer. 

17mm is larger than normal for lymph nodes, which are typically less than 1cm in healthy individuals. an enlarged lymph node is usually not a cause for concern if it's the result of an infection, which can cause temporary enlargement. 

however, considering you've had this lymph node for about 2.5 years and it's grown over the last 1.5 years, it would be advisable to consult with your doctor promptly. chronic fatigue can also indicate an underlying condition.

there is a possibility that the lymph node is benign, despite its enlarged size. but only your doctor can give you a definitive answer based on a thorough examination and testing. please try to stay calm while waiting for the results and avoid self-diagnosis."
N76,response_25,"while it is understandably worrisome to have a continually growing lymph node that you can feel, it is also important to keep in mind that there are many potential reasons why a lymph node might be enlarged. infections, both viral and bacterial, can cause lymph nodes to enlarge. chronic, non-infectious conditions such as autoimmune disorders and allergies can also cause lymph nodes to become enlarged. 

in terms of size, according to the radiology assistant, a lymph node is considered to be normal in size if it is below 10 mm. technically, a lymph node of 17 mm would be considered enlarged. however, the shape, the difference between short-axis and long-axis diameter and whether the capsule is still in place are also contributing factors. 

the fact that it has been described as ""normal appearing"" is positive, but the size and the change in size do warrant further investigation. the exact location of this node could make it part of the submandibular group, which can often become enlarged due to conditions in the head and neck, such as dental issues.

the constant fatigue could be related, but it's also a very nonspecific symptom that could be tied to many different things, including issues like depression, sleep disorders, anemia and others. 

i'm not a doctor, but my advice is to wait for your doctor's interpretation before jumping to conclusions. it's normal to be concerned, but try not to dwell on the worst-case scenarios."
