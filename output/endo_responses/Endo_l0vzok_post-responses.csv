Endo_l0vzok_post,no_prompt,"there are several potential reasons for the mid-cycle spotting you're experiencing. while it could possibly be implantation bleeding from a pregnancy, this would typically occur closer to when your period is due, and depends on your cycle length and when you have ovulated. intercourse itself can sometimes result in spotting. 

another reason could be hormonal fluctuations, which can be common after a surgery like a robotic assisted laparoscopic excision for endometriosis. your body might still be adjusting post-surgery.

also, remember that ovulation-tracking apps are not 100% accurate and only provide an estimate based on regularity of your previous cycles. sometimes, women can ovulate earlier or later.

however, given that you have stage 4 endometriosis and have recently had a surgery, it would be best to consult your doctor about this. they might want to rule out any complications or issues related to your surgery and/or endometriosis. your doctor can provide you with the most accurate advice based on your health history."
Endo_l0vzok_post,doc_prompt,"spotting after a laparoscopic excision for endometriosis can be due to various reasons including healing of the surgical site, hormonal changes or possibly implantation bleeding if you're trying to conceive. given that endometriosis can distort the normal menstrual cycle and ovulation, it can sometimes be challenging to predict the fertility window accurately. sperm can live up to 5 days inside a woman's body, so possibility of conception can exist even if intercourse was after the predicted ovulation day. 

however, a negative pregnancy test at 9 dpo (days postovulation) is not uncommon as the hormone hcg needs time to rise to detectable levels. if you continue to have irregular bleeding, severe pain or other worrying symptoms, please consult with your treating gynecologist. it might be important to rule out post-surgical complications or other gynecological conditions. please remember, online advice cannot replace a comprehensive medical examination."
Endo_l0vzok_post,pat_prompt,"between-period spotting post laparoscopic surgery may be related to your body healing and adjusting. however, since it's a new symptom for you, it warrants discussion with your healthcare provider, especially if it continues. 

regarding your concern on the implantation bleeding—the ""fertility window"" might not always be exact, especially if your cycles are still adjusting after surgery. so, it's possible to conceive even when you think you're outside the fertility window. a negative pregnancy test at 9dpo, however, could mean you're not pregnant, or it could be too early to tell – it’s usually recommended to test 12-14 days post ovulation. 

monitor your symptoms and consult your healthcare provider. they might request additional testing to clarify the source of bleeding. it’s always better to voice your concerns and get medical advice. also, remember the internet provides general advice – your healthcare provider, knowing you best, can guide you on your individual circumstances."
