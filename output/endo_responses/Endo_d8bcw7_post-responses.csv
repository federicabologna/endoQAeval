Endo_d8bcw7_post,doc_prompt,"your symptoms of frequent urination, persistent sensation to pee, and bladder pain after urinating may indeed be related to the scar tissue on your bladder from endometriosis. the scar tissue can affect the normal functioning and sensation of the bladder. however, other conditions, such as interstitial cystitis or overactive bladder syndrome, can cause similar symptoms. it's important that you follow up with your doctor or a urologist for a comprehensive evaluation. they may recommend further investigations such as a bladder ultrasound or cystoscopy to get a better understanding of your condition. please don't ignore these symptoms, get them checked by a professional as soon as possible to ensure proper treatment."
Endo_d8bcw7_post,pat_prompt,"yes, it's very possible that the scar tissue on your bladder is causing the urinary symptoms you're experiencing. endometriosis can cause adhesions, which are essentially bands of scar tissue that can attach to organs and cause discomfort or dysfunction. if these adhesions are on or near your bladder, they could be causing irritation and leading to frequent urination and pain. you might also feel that you haven't completely emptied your bladder even after peeing. it's important to communicate these symptoms to your doctor, as they may suggest changes in your treatment plan. additionally, pelvic physiotherapy could be beneficial in managing the discomfort. it's crucial to remember that everyone's body reacts differently, so what works for one person might not work for another."
