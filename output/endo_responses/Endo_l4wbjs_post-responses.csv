Endo_l4wbjs_post,pat_prompt,"the symptoms you're experiencing — notably the intense pain, heavy bleeding, and irregularity — are indeed common in endometriosis. the dark brown, almost black blood is typically old blood that has taken longer to exit the uterus. clots can happen when the blood flow is heavy and your body's anticoagulants can't keep up. however, everyone's body is different, and these symptoms can also associate with other conditions. therefore, it's essential to get a definitive diagnosis from a qualified medical professional. an ectopic pregnancy can have similar symptoms, but if the test was negative, it's likely not the cause. always make sure to communicate any concerns with your doctors, as they can help guide you through the process and confirm if these issues are due to endometriosis or potentially other factors."
