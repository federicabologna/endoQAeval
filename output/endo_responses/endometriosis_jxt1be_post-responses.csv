endometriosis_jxt1be_post,no_prompt,"sorry to hear that you're experiencing post-surgery discomfort. it's common for surgical procedures such as the one you've had to cause increased pain during your first few menstrual cycles as your body is still recovering. this can range from increased cramping to heavier bleeding, but should gradually subside as your body heals. if the pain is unbearable or if you start having heavy bleeding, consult your doctor immediately.

however, everyone is different and what you're experiencing may not be the norm for everyone. some people might experience no change or even an improvement in their symptoms after surgery, while others might have a worse time. it's important to remember that your body is unique and will react in its own way.

if you're planning to try for a pregnancy next year, it might be wise to discuss this with your doctor. they may be able to provide you with advice on how to manage your symptoms and pain during this time.

i hope your recovery goes well and you feel much better soon!"
endometriosis_jxt1be_post,doc_prompt,"it's not uncommon to experience increased pain during your first period following excision surgery to treat endometriosis. this could be due to a number of reasons including the body's healing process, inflammation response, or even menstrual fluids coming into contact with healing areas. the dark brown and bright red blood could indeed be menstrual blood. dark brown usually indicates older blood that has been in the uterus for a longer time and bright red indicates fresher blood. however, note that if the pain persists or becomes unmanageable, itâ€™s important to reach out to your healthcare provider right away. there might be a need to revisit your pain management plan or check for any complications post-surgery."
endometriosis_jxt1be_post,pat_prompt,"it's common for the first period or two after endometriosis surgery to be particularly painful, even more so than before the operation. surgery provokes significant inflammation and irritation to your pelvic tissues, which may be exacerbated by menstrual hormones. blood clots and changes in bleeding can also occur due to temporary changes in hormonal balance or post-surgical changes in the uterus. it's important to let your doctor know about these symptoms, even if they subside. usually, this doesn't signify any complication, but this should be confirmed by your doctor. continuing with your iud as per your doctor's advice sounds sensible, but make sure its current symptoms aren't contributing to your increased pain. it should get easier with time, but don't hesitate to reach out for medical advice when needed."
