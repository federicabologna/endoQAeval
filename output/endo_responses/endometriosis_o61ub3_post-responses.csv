you generally should not insert anything (like tampons or devices for sexual pleasure) into the vagina for a certain period after an endometrial ablation and tubal ligation. the aim is to prevent infection and allow the lining of the uterus to heal, especially after endometrial ablation.

as for external stimulation or ""vibrational therapy"", most medical professionals would probably advise you to wait until any bleeding has ended and you've had a postoperative check-up to confirm your healing is progressing properly.

remember that even if you're not feeling pain, your body is still healing and you don't want to risk causing any internal damage or complications.

this is a delicate situation and you should absolutely contact your healthcare provider and have a detailed conversation about what is safe for you at this stage in your healing process."

endometriosis_o61ub3_post,pat_prompt,"after any surgical procedure, it's best to wait until your doctor gives you an ok to resume sexual activities, including masturbation. although you might not be feeling any pain, your body might still be healing internally. in general, many doctors recommend waiting for four to six weeks after such procedures. however, keep in mind this is just a general guideline; each person's recovery may be different. with non-penetrative masturbation, like use of vibrational therapy on the clitoris, you may likely be able to start earlier. it's crucial though to listen to your body and stop if you experience any discomfort. however, you should still bring up this matter at your post-operative check-up to get the most accurate advice regarding your specific situation."
