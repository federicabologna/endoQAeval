endometriosis_pw76gg_post,no_prompt,"i'm not a doctor, but i can share some general observations based on your situation that you may want to discuss with your doctor. some women do experience changes in their menstrual cycle, such as light or heavy bleeding, or spotting in-between periods when they first start taking a new birth control pill. it may take a few cycles for your body to adjust to the new hormones. 

however, since you've been bleeding for 3 weeks now, it's essential that you consult with your gynecologist to possibly revise your contraceptive regimen. they can discuss other forms of hormonal birth control that could be less likely to interfere with your breastfeeding, control your menstrual bleeding or use non-hormonal methods that might have fewer side effects. 

iuds (intrauterine devices) are one example, especially hormonal iuds such as mirena and skyla, which often cause lighter periods or sometimes stop them altogether. 

you might also have an underlying condition such as fibroids or endometriosis which could be causing your heavy bleeding and pain. your doctor can help diagnose these conditions through exams or imaging studies.

please note that this advice is intended to be general in nature, and specific causes may not apply to your situation. always"
endometriosis_pw76gg_post,doc_prompt,"i understand your concerns and you're right to seek some clarification. extended bleeding is a common side effect when first starting on birth control pills like yaz, especially when shifting from progesterone-only treatments. your body needs time to adjust to the new hormone levels. however, bleeding for 3 weeks continuously is a bit unusual and you should report this to your gynecologist during your visit. the doctor may suggest a higher-dose birth control pill, or alternative treatments for endometriosis. non-hormonal options like nsaids or even surgical procedures can also be a part of the discussion, depending on your condition's severity. it's good that your pain is reduced which suggests that the treatment is having some effect. ultimately, your doctor will consider your symptoms, health history, and personal preferences to choose the best treatment for you."
endometriosis_pw76gg_post,pat_prompt,"it seems like the progesterone-only pill was helpful for controlling your bleeding but causing psychological side effects, and yaz is not providing the same level of bleeding control. the continuous, light bleeding you're experiencing is called breakthrough bleeding and can be a common side effect of hormonal birth control, especially during the first few months of use. however, it may also be an indication that yaz may not be the perfect fit for managing your endometriosis symptoms. a different formulation or dosage might be beneficial. your gynecologist might suggest trying a different type of combined pill (one containing both estrogen and progesterone), an iud or an implant, or even a gnrh analog. it's about finding the right balance for you as an individual, so remember to clearly communicate your experiences and symptoms to your gynecologist. lastly, don't feel strange about speaking up. it's your body, and you have a right to seek comfort and effective treatment."
