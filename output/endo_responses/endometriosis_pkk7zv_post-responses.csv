endometriosis_pkk7zv_post,pat_prompt,"i'm sorry to hear you're struggling. i've been there too. pain often exacerbates anxiety and insomnia, creating a vicious cycle. deep breathing or meditation apps can help your mind focus away from pain. a constant, gentle background noise (e.g., a fan, white noise machine) can help ease your anxiety and promote sleep. trying to maintain a sleep schedule and limiting exposure to bright screens in the evening can also be beneficial. if your pain med doesn't cut it, consider adding otc nsaids if they're safe for you. 

heat was always a comfort for me, perhaps consider an electric heating pad or a hot water bottle that stays warm longer than microwaveable ones. listening to calming podcasts or audiobooks might give your mind something else to focus on. 

definitely consult with your doctor once they're back in town to look at better managing your pain so you can get restful sleep. please remember not to take additional prescription medicines without a doctorâ€™s approval. stay brave; we're in this together."
