Endo_pjdpxj_post,no_prompt,"i'm an ai developed by openai and while i can't replace a consultation with healthcare provider, i can suggest what might be discussed during one. bright red blood in the middle of your cycle could indicate many things. it might be a simple, normal variation of your menstrual cycle. stress, weight changes, and certain medications can also cause mid-cycle bleeding. 

however, given your history of endometriosis and the changes in your period and sexual discomfort, a more relevant likelihood could be that the endometriosis is progressing. some women with endometriosis do experience mid-cycle bleeding or ""spotting."" this is because the endometrial tissue outside the uterus responds to hormonal changes just like the tissue inside the uterus, causing bleeding.

it also could be due to other medical reasons like polyps, fibroids and in rare cases, cervical or uterine cancers.

any changes in your menstrual cycle should be evaluated by your doctor, especially given your history of endometriosis. i would recommend contacting your healthcare provider to discuss these new symptoms. they may want to perform a physical examination, and possibly an ultrasound to better understand what is happening internally. 

keep in mind such advice is meant to be general advice, and specific"
Endo_pjdpxj_post,doc_prompt,"it's not uncommon for symptoms to change or intensify over time with endometriosis. mid-cycle bleeding can happen due to hormonal variations, but rarely, it could be a sign of something more serious. progression of endometriosis or a new, concurrent issue could also present with these changes. i would recommend a follow-up with your gynaecologist who may suggest a pelvic ultrasound, tests to rule out infections or other conditions. while it's understandable to be concerned about further surgical intervention, your increasing symptoms and changes in your cycle warrant a thorough evaluation. please remember it's important to prioritize your comfort and health."
Endo_pjdpxj_post,pat_prompt,"it sounds like you're experiencing some concerning symptoms, and it's important that you report these changes to your healthcare provider. first, heavier periods and increased pain could indicate progression of your endometriosis or another health issue. as for the mid-cycle bleeding, it can sometimes happen with ovulation but should not be heavy or persist. while it might be a one-time event, repeated occurrences could signal a hormonal imbalance, polyp, or another condition. this is worth discussing with your doctor. if your current physician is hesitant to further investigate your concerns, it could be worthwhile to seek a second opinion. remember, it's your body and you have the right to understand what's happening and all your available treatment options. your health is paramount, and you deserve proper care and attention."
