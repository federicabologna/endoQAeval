Endo_oiwty6_post,pat_prompt,"endometriosis indeed has correlations with hormonal changes and mood swings. the disease is sensitive to estradiol, a type of estrogen, which can fluctuate throughout your menstrual cycle and can intensify both your physical pain and emotional distress during a flare-up. additionally, the physical stress and persistent pain can also affect your mood, causing feelings of depression or anxiety. it's important to note that while hormonal changes can influence your mood, emotional distress can also come from the challenges of managing a chronic condition like endometriosis. so, your mood swings could be partly hormonal, but also related to the physical and emotional burden of the disease. pursuing a comprehensive treatment plan that includes pain management, hormonal therapy, and mental health support may help in easing your symptoms. please consult with your healthcare provider for the most accurate guidance."
