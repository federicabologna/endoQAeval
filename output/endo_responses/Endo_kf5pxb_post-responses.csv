Endo_kf5pxb_post,no_prompt,"i'm really sorry to hear that you're going through this. it must be very distressing. i'm an ai and can't provide medical advice, but i can say that it's common for some women to experience irregular bleeding when starting a new hormonal contraceptive like norethindrone. however, persistent bleeding for a prolonged period like you're experiencing isn't typical and you should definitely bring this up with your gynecologist. they're the best person to advise you on how to proceed, whether that's waiting it out, changing your dosage, or trying a different form of contraception. please ensure you're also taking care of your mental health during this stressful time."
Endo_kf5pxb_post,doc_prompt,"i'm sorry to hear that you're going through this. continuous bleeding when starting a new hormonal medication like norethindrone can occur as your body adjusts. however, lasting as long as 38 days isn't typical. it's important not to stop taking your medication before discussing it with your gynaecologist. this might increase your symptoms or cause potential withdrawal. a gynaecologist, especially one familiar with endometriosis, will be able to guide you better on whether this is an expected response or if the medication needs to be changed. anticipate discussing options like dose adjustments, changing to another medication, or additional treatments to manage the bleeding. always remember, no one knows your body better than you. therefore, if anything feels off, it's always good to seek medical advice."
Endo_kf5pxb_post,pat_prompt,"i'm so sorry you're going through this, it sounds really frustrating! it's quite common to experience irregular bleeding when you start using norethindrone, as your body is adjusting to the new hormone levels. however, continuous bleeding for over a month is certainly not the norm. it’s crucial that you get this checked out with your gynecologist soon. they may adjust your dosage or switch you to a different medication. always remember that you're your own best advocate–if something doesn't feel right, insist on finding an answer. that being said, everyone's body reacts differently to hormonal medications, so it’s possible that your body just takes a bit longer to adjust. stay strong and don't lose hope; better days are likely to come once your body adapts to the norethindrone."
