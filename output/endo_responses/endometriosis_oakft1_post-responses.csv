endometriosis_oakft1_post,no_prompt,"it's great to hear that your pain has significantly decreased after surgery! this is a very desirable outcome, and you may be experiencing less pain because of the procedure. even though no endometriosis was found, the doctor mentioned that she was extremely aggressive with the excision and removed the entire pelvic lining. this might have eliminated any anomalies that might have been causing your pain.

it's also important to remember that endometriosis is only one possible cause of pelvic pain. even if endometriosis wasn't found, your symptoms could have been caused by other issues, such as myofascial pelvic pain, which you were diagnosed with.

doing pelvic pt as recommended by your doctor is another good step towards managing and reducing your pain. 

if you ever become concerned about your condition or the efficacy of your treatment, do not hesitate to talk with your doctor or seek a second opinion. it's always good to be informed and involved in your own health. but for now, if the pain has subsided and your doctor sees no cause for concern based on your tests and your surgery, it sounds like a hopeful and positive situation."
endometriosis_oakft1_post,doc_prompt,"it's possible your pain reduction is due to the extensive excision of the pelvic lining done by your doctor. by removing potentially inflamed or irritated tissue, this could provide substantial relief. the fact your biopsies came back negative indicates that the pain may not have been caused by endometriosis, supporting the diagnosis of myofascial pelvic pain. however, endometriosis can sometimes be missed in biopsies, especially if it's microscopic or deep within tissues. your improving symptoms are a good sign, and paired with your pelvic pt, offer a positive outcome. it wasn't mentioned whether you are currently on any pain management or hormonal therapy which could also affect your pain levels. while getting a second opinion can reassure you, given your significant improvement, it might not be immediately necessary. however, if symptoms recur or worsen, that could be the right time to consider it."
endometriosis_oakft1_post,pat_prompt,"your experience is indeed fascinating and worth noting. while it's possible the surgeon may have missed some endometriosis during the excision, there's also a chance that the extensive pelvic excision itself helped address some of the pain. even if no endometriosis was found, the procedure could have removed other tissue or adhesions causing pain. 

as per your confusion, it could be beneficial to get a second opinion. however, since your pain has dramatically decreased, you might prioritize focusing on your recovery and new-found relief. when it comes to endometriosis, there's a lot that's still not completely understood. instead of dwelling on the uncertainty, focus on the positive outcome you're experiencing. 

bear in mind that the diagnosis of myofascial pelvic pain also supports the result you're feeling. pelvic pt could further promote healing and pain management. remember to still report any changes in your symptoms to your doctor as they occur."
