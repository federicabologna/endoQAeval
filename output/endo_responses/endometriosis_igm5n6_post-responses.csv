endometriosis_igm5n6_post,no_prompt,"breast enlargement and tenderness prior to a menstrual period is actually a common phenomenon that many women experience. the hormonal fluctuations throughout your menstrual cycle can cause changes in your breasts, such as bloating, tenderness, and enlargement. this is typically due to the increase in estrogen and progesterone levels. 

on the other hand, endometriosis is a condition where tissue similar to the lining of the uterus is found outside of the uterus, often affecting the ovaries, fallopian tubes, and the tissue lining the pelvis. though endometriosis can cause many symptoms, including painful periods, it is not typically associated with changes in breast size or tenderness. 

as always, if you have concerns, it's a good idea to consult with your healthcare provider."
endometriosis_igm5n6_post,doc_prompt,"breast enlargement and tenderness you're describing are common symptoms of premenstrual syndrome (pms) and not typically associated with endometriosis. in the days before your period, hormonal fluctuations can cause fluid retention and increased blood flow, leading to breast swelling and tenderness. however, if you're experiencing other symptoms such as severe pelvic pain, heavy periods, or pain during intercourse, these could be signs of endometriosis and warrant further medical evaluation. if the breast symptoms are particularly bothersome or you're concerned about any other symptoms, it would be advisable to consult your healthcare provider."
endometriosis_igm5n6_post,pat_prompt,"breast tenderness and enlargement before your period are common symptoms associated with premenstrual syndrome (pms), not necessarily endometriosis. hormonal changes during your menstrual cycle cause these symptoms. as estrogen and progesterone levels rise, they cause your breast cells to enlarge, often leading to pain or discomfort. remember endometriosis is a condition where endometrial-like tissue grows outside the uterus. if you suspect you have endometriosis, look out for symptoms like severe period pain, pain during or after sexual intercourse, and fertility issues, among others. if you're worried about any symptoms, it's always best to consult with your healthcare provider."
