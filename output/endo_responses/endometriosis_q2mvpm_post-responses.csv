laparoscopic surgery for endometriosis is less invasive than a c-section, but it still requires rest for recovery. generally, you may be able to walk and move around a few hours following the procedure, but it is advisable not to engage in strenuous activities like lifting heavy items (including a young child) for at least a week or two. pain can vary from mild to severe depending on the individual and the extent of disease and treatment.
