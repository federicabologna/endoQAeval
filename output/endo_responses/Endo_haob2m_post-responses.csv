firstly, it's absolutely normal to feel overwhelmed and question your decision in situations like these. when it comes to your body and health, you need to make sure the decisions you make are right for you.

endometriosis and hormonal birth control can be a complex issue. hormonal birth control like the pill can help control the symptoms of endometriosis but everybody reacts differently to different types of hormonal birth control. for some people, it can exacerbate symptoms and others it can help.

having periods won’t necessarily exacerbate your endometriosis. some research suggests that long-term use of the combined contraceptive pill (the 'pill') can reduce the risk of developing endometriosis. but this isn’t consistently found and other factors might be involved.

as for your fertility, endometriosis can create challenges for fertility, but it doesn't mean you'll be unable to have children. hormonal contraceptives themselves do not affect long-term fertility.

you should do what feels right for you. there's no right or wrong answer, everyone with endometriosis responds differently"
Endo_haob2m_post,doc_prompt,"managing endometriosis is often based on individual response to treatments. you describe being well settled on your current pill, save for erratic periods. having regular periods while on the pill does not directly exacerbate endometriosis nor does it directly affect future fertility. there's no need to rush decisions about switching medications or procedures, especially if you're managing well currently. intense pain or progressive symptoms would necessitate reconsideration of management options. it's always important to openly communicate with your physician about your experiences and concerns, so she can best support and guide you. this might also reduce feelings of guilt or pressure. remember, the decision ultimately lies with you, the patient. your well-being and comfort with the treatment plan are of paramount importance."
Endo_haob2m_post,pat_prompt,"it's important to remember that managing endometriosis is highly individualistic. what might worsen symptoms for one person could alleviate them for another. that being said, endometriosis feeds on estrogen and the aim of hormonal contraceptives is to regulate or suppress your estrogen levels. so, continuing with your current pill may not necessarily exacerbate your endo symptoms. regarding fertility, prolonged endometriosis can cause issues, but it does not mean it is guaranteed. there's also evidence showing hormonal contraceptives can help preserve fertility by slowing endometriosis progression. however, each scenario is unique - you should discuss your fertility concerns with your doctor. you should never feel pressured to make immediate treatment decisions. it's essential to take your time, do your research, and choose what feels right for you. if you're currently managing your pain and are comfortable with your routine, consider continuing that. if your symptoms start to worsen or affect your quality of life, then you should revisit other treatment options. remember, what matters most is your comfort and wellbeing."
