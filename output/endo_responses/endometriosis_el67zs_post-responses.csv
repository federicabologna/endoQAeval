endometriosis_el67zs_post,no_prompt,"i'm an ai developed by openai, so bear in mind that nothing beats a proper consultation, but it seems like you may be experiencing symptoms of a condition called endometriosis. this is a disorder in which tissue similar to the tissue that forms the lining of your uterus grows outside of your uterine cavity. it can cause chronic pain, heavy periods, painful sex, and other symptoms.

menstrual symptoms can be very challenging, but they shouldn't interfere excessively with one's daily lifestyle. if they do, that's a signal to consult a healthcare provider. 

you mentioned that you have pain during sex, with orgasms, and sometimes even when not on your period. these are definitely symptoms that you should discuss with a health professional who can then determine if further tests or treatment are needed. 

remember that even if you're dealing with a physical health issue, your mental health is important, too. the exhaustion and burnout you're feeling could be related to stress or other emotional factors. it's okay to seek help for these feelings.  

ultimately, please book an appointment with your healthcare provider as soon as possible to get checked out."
endometriosis_el67zs_post,doc_prompt,"i'm sorry to hear about the symptoms you're experiencing. endometriosis often presents with pelvic pain, particularly with periods or sexual intercourse, and may be associated with digestive symptoms. your symptoms such as painful sex, cramps outside of your period and specifically cramps when orgasming, as well as spiking pain up rectum, could potentially be indicative of endometriosis. however, there may be other explanations for these symptoms too. constant exhaustion, oversensitivity and body weakness require further examination as they can relate to many different conditions other than endometriosis. it's very important to see a healthcare professional for a thorough assessment, and potentially a referral to a specialist. an in-person consultation with physical examination and possibly imaging and lab tests are crucial for reaching an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan. don't hesitate to reach out for professional help -- your pain is valid and it’s important to understand what is causing it."
endometriosis_el67zs_post,pat_prompt,"i'm sorry to hear you're feeling this way, but remember i'm not a doctor. your symptoms indeed match those that are often associated with endometriosis — particularly your main concerns of pain during sex, rectal pain, and cramps with orgasm. they are not normal period symptoms. the digestive issues you mentioned can also be a part of endometriosis, as the disease can affect the bowel. the constant exhaustion and sensitivity might be related to chronic pain or other related conditions like irritable bowel syndrome or interstitial cystitis. 

it's crucial to note that endometriosis can only be definitively diagnosed through a laparoscopic surgery. i recommend you to discuss your symptoms with a healthcare provider, preferably a gynecologist specializing in endometriosis. they can help determine the best course of action for diagnosis and treatment, which can significantly improve your quality of life. don't hesitate to reach out for help or further information."
