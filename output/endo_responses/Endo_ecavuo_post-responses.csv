Endo_ecavuo_post,no_prompt,"i'm an ai, not a doctor, but based on general knowledge, the duration of pain after a laparoscopy (lap) can vary between individuals. many people reportedly experience a decrease in pain within a week, but some may experience discomfort for several weeks after the surgery. if you are experiencing severe cramps and passing clots two weeks post-op, it may be best to consult with your doctor immediately, even if there's no blood. post-operative complications such as infection or hemorrhage may occasionally occur and require medical attention. this could also be related to menstruation or underlying conditions. ensure you rest, stay hydrated, and manage pain in the meanwhile with over-the-counter painkillers only if recommended by your healthcare professional. but do contact your doctor as soon as possible."
Endo_ecavuo_post,doc_prompt,"it's perfectly normal to experience post-operative pain, discomfort, and other symptoms, but if your pain is severe or concerns you, it's essential to seek immediate medical attention. increased pain or passing clots two weeks after a laparoscopy isn't usual. these may be an indication of post-operative complications or issues that might not be directly related to your surgery. it's advisable to contact your surgeon or a healthcare provider immediately to rule out any possible complications. while some women feel relief from the symptoms of endometriosis soon after a laparoscopy, others might not experience relief for several weeks. but two weeks into recovery, intense pain is not typical."
Endo_ecavuo_post,pat_prompt,"i'm sorry to hear about your pain. recovery time after a laparoscopy varies between individuals. some may recover quickly while for others, it may take longer. however, severe pain two weeks after surgery might not be typical. it could potentially signify complications such as an infection. it's particularly concerning if you're passing clots. in such instances, my advice is to immediately reach out to your healthcare provider. don't ignore the pain or hope it will just disappear. get professional advice as only they can accurately diagnose your condition. in the meanwhile, ensure you're resting adequately and staying hydrated. remember to take your prescribed pain medication. please get immediate help."
