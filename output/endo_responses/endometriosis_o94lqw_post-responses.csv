1. **discuss the lactose issue with your doctor**: the first thing, if you haven't already done it, is to let your doctor know about your theory involving lactose. they might be able to check if there are any alternatives to yaz+ without lactose available in your area.

2. **consider hormonal iuds or implants**: these alternatives also release hormones into your body to prevent pregnancy and can significantly lower your likelihood of developing new cysts. they often have a different hormone mix than oral contraceptives, which might interact differently with your system.

3. **look into endometriosis treatments**: there are several other treatments for endometriosis that you might consider exploring, such as other hormonal therapies (like the use of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (gn-rh) agonists and antagonists, progestin therapy or danazol), conservative surgery (to remove as much endometriosis as possible while preserving your uterus and ovaries), or, in"
endometriosis_o94lqw_post,doc_prompt,"your situation sounds challenging indeed. lactose in medication might not be the cause of your symptoms. however, it is worth discussing it with your doctor for potential alternatives. non-pill options for managing endometriosis include the hormonal iud, which includes brands such as mirena and skyla; contraceptive implants like nexplanon; or injections such as depo-provera. these alternatives aim to provide hormone regulation similar to birth control pills but don't contain lactose. always discuss potential side effects with your healthcare provider before starting a new treatment. furthermore, an allergist might help determine if you’re having a reaction to any medication ingredients. always remember to balance your desire for symptom relief with the potential side effects of any treatment. -*-"
endometriosis_o94lqw_post,pat_prompt,"i'm sorry to hear about your struggles. it's important to know that everyone responds differently to medication, so your reactions may be unique to you. if you believe your symptoms are due to lactose in your birth control (yaz+), it's critical to discuss this with your doctor. you mentioned being worried about the recurrence of endometriosis and cyst growth if you stop taking yaz+. there are certainly other treatment options available that don’t contain lactose. for example, hormone therapy injections, such as gonadotropin-releasing hormone (gn-rh) agonists/antagonists, or progestin injections or intrauterine devices. there are also various surgeries, including conservative surgery to remove/end treat endometriosis while preserving your uterus and ovaries, or radical surgery like hysterectomy as a last resort. it's also possible to manage some symptoms with pain relievers. discuss these options with your healthcare provider or consider seeking a second opinion from a specialist in endometriosis. research, ask questions, and keep pushing until you find the treatment plan that works best for you."
