endometriosis_op3b4i_post,no_prompt,"i'm an ai and not a doctor, but your symptoms may indeed be related to endometriosis. endometriosis can cause severe pelvic pain, especially during periods, and symptoms may include pain with intercourse, pain with bowel movements or urination, excessive bleeding, fatigue, diarrhea, constipation, bloating or nausea, among other symptoms. however, it's important to note that your symptoms could indicate other medical conditions as well.

also, endometriosis can only be definitively diagnosed by a doctor. if the pain you're experiencing is severe and/or sudden, it could indicate a medical emergency, such as an ovarian torsion or an ectopic pregnancy, among others. i strongly recommend you to seek urgent medical attention. whatever the reason, severe pain is a signal that you should get medical help right away."
endometriosis_op3b4i_post,doc_prompt,"it sounds like you're in significant pain and distress, and while your symptoms could potentially be related to endometriosis, they could also be indicative of other serious conditions such as ovarian torsion, an infection, or another type of pelvic pathology. it's imperative that you seek immediate medical attention. this is especially true if you're experiencing a sudden, severe pain that is different from what you've previously experienced. while it's not possible to diagnose the cause over the internet, you need an in-person evaluation by a healthcare provider to determine what's causing your symptoms and how to best treat them. please, don't delay seeking care."
endometriosis_op3b4i_post,pat_prompt,"i'm so sorry you're going through this, it sounds awful. as an endometriosis patient myself, i can tell you that these symptoms can certainly be related to endo, but it's always important to rule out other causes. the nature and intensity of endo pain can vary from person to person and can change over time, with different triggers. usually endo pain is continuous, but it can be more noticeable with movement. 

however, if this is a new experience for you and the pain is as intense as you describe, i strongly advise you to seek immediate medical attention. this could be a sign of a cyst rupture or torsion, or even something unrelated to endo. it's better to be safe than sorry. please take care."
