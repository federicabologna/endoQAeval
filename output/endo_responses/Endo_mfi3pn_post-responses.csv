Endo_mfi3pn_post,no_prompt,"i'm really sorry to hear that you're going through this. it sounds incredibly difficult. in terms of endometriosis, it's unfortunately true that diagnosis is most often confirmed with a surgical procedure called laparoscopy. this is because endometriosis lesions don't show up on ultrasound or mri, unless the disease is advanced. 

in terms of treatments, hormone therapy is often the first line of treatment with the goal of preventing new growths and reducing the size of existing growths. hormonal contraceptives, progestins, and gnrh (gonadotropin-releasing hormone) agonists are types of hormone therapies used. some women find relief with these options, but others like yourself experience side effects that make them uncomfortable. 

pain medication is also used, from over-the-counter nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (such as ibuprofen), to prescription drugs. 

physical therapy and certain lifestyle changes (like diet adjustments) may also help in managing symptoms, though more research is needed in these areas.

surgery, as mentioned, can be done to remove endometriosis implants, though this is usually reserved for cases of severe pain, infertility, or abnormal bleeding after other treatments have been tried."
Endo_mfi3pn_post,doc_prompt,"i'm sorry to hear about your struggles. yes, endometriosis is often diagnosed through laparoscopic surgery, though some advanced imaging methods like mri or ultrasound can sometimes help. the treatment often depends on the severity and your plans for pregnancy. pain medication, hormone therapy like birth control pills, progestin therapy, or gonadotropin-releasing hormone (gnrh) agonists can be used. laparoscopic surgery can also remove the endometriosis tissue, providing relief. for severe cases, hysterectomy (removal of the uterus) can be considered. if hormonal treatments like birth control pills aren't suitable for you, there may be other options. do note that a gluten-free diet might help just by reducing inflammation in general. you may want to seek a second opinion from a specialist in endometriosis to discuss these options and confirm the diagnosis."
Endo_mfi3pn_post,pat_prompt,"i'm very sorry to hear about your struggle. indeed, the gold standard for diagnosing endometriosis is through a laparoscopic procedure, which does have the risk of scarring. however, it is still the most definitive way to diagnose. some doctors may also employ ultrasound or mri to get an idea if endometriosis is present, but these can't verify it. for treatments, options include pain medications (like nsaids), hormonal treatments (e.g. birth control pills, patches, various iuds), gnrh analogs, and surgery. specifically regarding birth control, there are many types - if one makes you feel unwell, other ones could be a better fit. also, dietary changes, regular physical activity, and alternative therapies like acupuncture or yoga can sometimes help manage symptoms. finally, note that an endometriosis diagnosis can explain some miscarriages, but not all. it's a complicated disease, so having a good partner in your doctor is really essential to managing your situation."
