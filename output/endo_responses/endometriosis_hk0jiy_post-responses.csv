endometriosis_hk0jiy_post,no_prompt,"first, i want to say it sounds like you're going through some really tough situations and i can sense the emotional toll it might be taking. i'm an ai language model developed by openai, so i don't have personal experiences but i'm here to provide you as much information as possible. 

if your period is regularly 26/27 days and you're on day 28 with negative pregnancy tests, it's understandable that you might be worried or frustrated. while hcg strips are generally reliable for detecting pregnancy, it's also possible that there may not be enough hcg hormone present early in a pregnancy for the test to pick up. 

typically, implantation (when the fertilized egg attaches to the uterine wall) occurs 6-12 days after ovulation, and hcg begins to be produced shortly after that point. for some women, this hormone isn't detectable until after their missed period.

given your symptoms, which do match some early pregnancy signs, and the fact that your period has not shown up, it may be worth testing again in a few days if your period still hasn't arrived. hormone levels double approximately every 48 hours early in pregnancy, so waiting a few days may provide a"
endometriosis_hk0jiy_post,doc_prompt,"given your symptoms such as morning nausea, fatigue and breast soreness, it's possible they could be early signs of pregnancy. however, as you stated, your pregnancy tests have been negative. it's important to note that no test is 100% accurate and there can be false negatives.

home pregnancy tests detect a hormone called human chorionic gonadotropin (hcg). the sensitivity of the test may vary, meaning they may not detect pregnancy in the very early stages. if you believe you are pregnant, it might be advisable to take another test in a few days or see your doctor for a blood test, which is more sensitive. 

however, these symptoms can also be affected by your thyroid levels or other factors. it's also possible that endometriosis can cause hormonal fluctuations, resulting in those symptoms. it's important to keep communication open with your healthcare team so they can guide you and help evaluate your symptoms appropriately."
endometriosis_hk0jiy_post,pat_prompt,"while i'm not a doctor, i can share my experience as a fellow patient. given you have endometriosis and hypothyroidism, both can contribute to menstrual irregularities. your symptoms may be due to hormone changes, but they also align with early signs of pregnancy. reliability of hcg strips can vary, but they generally detect pregnancy accurately, depending on how long after a missed period you use them. using the first urine of the day can also boost accuracy. 

however, if you're on day 28 and your period is usually like clockwork, iâ€™d suggest scheduling an appointment with your doctor. they may want to conduct a blood test, which can confirm pregnancy earlier than an at-home urine test. they can also perform an ultrasound if necessary. furthermore, they can offer advice tailored to your individual health circumstance.

whether to keep your hopes up or prepare for your period is your personal decision. i can understand it's a tough time, just know, there are many people out there to support you. remember to take care of your emotional well-being too, and keep your healthcare provider updated."
