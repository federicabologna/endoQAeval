the bartholin's glands, located on each side of the vaginal opening, secrete fluid that helps lubricate the vagina. sometimes, the openings of these glands become obstructed, causing fluid to back up into the gland. the result is relatively painless swelling called a bartholin's cyst. if the fluid within the gland becomes infected, you may develop a collection of pus surrounded by inflamed tissue (an abscess).

bartholin cysts or abscesses are quite common and they aren't sexually transmitted, although they can be caused by various bacteria including ones that cause sexually transmitted infections. symptoms may include a tender, painful lump near the vaginal opening; discomfort when walking or sitting; and pain during sexual intercourse. hormonal changes or physical activity don't typically cause bartholin's cysts, but these cysts can become more painful during your period.

your issue may also be related to other conditions such as folliculitis, infected hair follicle, or possibly a skin condition such as hidradenitis suppurativa.

Endo_mvn9ly_post,doc_prompt,"your symptoms could be indicative of a recurrent bartholin's cyst, which occurs near the vaginal entrance and can cause discomfort. these cysts aren't always directly related to endometriosis or hormonal issues. instead, they typically form when the ducts of the bartholin's glands, which secrete fluid to lubricate the vagina, get blocked. unrelated to your menstrual cycle, activities like walking (particularly in a thong, which may cause friction) might exacerbate the discomfort. that said, it's crucial not to self-diagnose. although your symptoms may be caused by a bartholin's cyst, it's possible that they could be due to another condition, including endometriosis or an infection. please schedule an appointment with a healthcare provider to get a proper evaluation and treatment, if necessary."
Endo_mvn9ly_post,pat_prompt,"it sounds like you might be experiencing bartholin's cysts, which occur when the bartholin's glands located on each side of the vaginal opening become blocked. it could be related to hormonal changes, as these glands produce lubricating fluid during sexual arousal. however, bartholin's cysts aren't generally associated with endometriosis, which involves endometrial tissue growing outside of the uterus. still, it's possible to have both conditions simultaneously. while walking and wearing certain clothing could potentially irritate an existing cyst it wouldn't cause them. these cysts may come and go naturally. if it becomes too painful or if you notice recurrent episodes, please consult with a healthcare provider. additionally, they could advise on methods to help prevent future cysts."
