endometriosis_ddu815_post,no_prompt,"as an ai built by openai, i can give you a broad advice based on the symptoms you've mentioned, such as heavy periods, painful menstruation, and changes in bowel habits which might suggest conditions like endometriosis. however, it's not a surety, as these symptoms are common with many conditions. particularly considering the fact that you are a young woman, these could be related to hormonal fluctuations too.

endometriosis is a condition where tissue similar to the lining of the uterus is found outside of the uterus. it can cause symptoms like painful periods, heavy bleeding, and problems with bowel movements. however, this condition typically affects older women. it's relatively rare in teenagers but it can start during adolescence.

most importantly, you should always let your parent/guardian know about your symptoms and consult with a healthcare professional for accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment. they may conduct a variety of tests like ultrasonography, blood tests, or potentially even a laparoscopy to know what exactly is going on. 

please take actions immediately if you are experiencing significant discomfort or if your symptoms are causing distress."
endometriosis_ddu815_post,doc_prompt,"while it is true that heavy bleeding, severe cramps and gastrointestinal symptoms such as constipation and nausea can indicate endometriosis, they can also be linked to several other conditions. irregular menstrual cycles and heavy periods are quite common in the early years of menstruation as your hormonal systems are still maturing. however, the severity and multitude of your symptoms is concerning and warrants further investigation. please schedule an appointment with a healthcare provider as soon as possible to discuss these symptoms and possibly conduct further tests. it's important to get a confirmed diagnosis either way for prompt management and relief of your symptoms."
endometriosis_ddu815_post,pat_prompt,"your symptoms could be indicative of endometriosis, but also align with other conditions like polycystic ovarian syndrome (pcos) or certain hormone imbalances. it's important you see a healthcare provider as soon as possible for a thorough evaluation. they may conduct a pelvic exam, ultrasound, or even laparoscopy to confirm a diagnosis. remember, early detection can lead to more effective treatment plans. ensure you communicate all your symptoms to your doctor in detail. also, there are various effective pain management strategies and other treatments for menstrual disorders, so don't lose hope if you're diagnosed with a condition. always consult with your healthcare provider for accurate information."
