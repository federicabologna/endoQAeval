hormonal birth control is commonly used to try and manage endometriosis symptoms. if you're facing side effects from birth control, it's important that you discuss them with your healthcare provider. they can guide you on whether you should discontinue them or not.

information does exist suggesting that birth control may not stop endometriosis from spreading, but could instead control symptoms. however, everyone's experience with endometriosis can be unique and some people still find relief with birth control. the decision to continue or stop any medication should always be made in consultation with your healthcare provider. furthermore, the possible diagnosis of endometriosis should ideally be confirmed with relevant investigations.

given that you're having a tough time with side effects, i would strongly advise you to get in contact with your doctor for personalized advice based on your medical history and symptoms."
Endo_meqhlv_post,doc_prompt,"before making any decisions to stop your birth control, consult with your gynecologist or primary care doctor first. hormonal birth control often helps manage endometriosis symptoms, but it doesn't necessarily stop the progression of the disease. its primary effect is to regulate your hormones and reduce the severity of your symptoms. your side effects may be a temporary reaction as your body adjusts to the medication. nonetheless, persistent discomfort warrants a discussion with your doctor, who can consider other treatments tailored to your situation. remember, self-management without professional guidance may lead to complications or worsening of your condition."
