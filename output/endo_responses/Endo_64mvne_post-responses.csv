Endo_64mvne_post,no_prompt,"cyst pain can vary widely from person to person, and what you're describing could potentially be related to a cyst. the location and the throbbing, persistent nature of the pain, its increase with pressure, and the accompanying nausea do align with some experiences of ovarian cyst pain.

ovarian cysts often cause a sharp or dull ache in the lower abdomen on the side of the cyst, which can radiate to the lower back and thigh. the pain often begins suddenly and may be severe, and can be intermittent or continuous. 

however, keep in mind that many other conditions, such as kidney stones or gastrointestinal problems, can cause similar symptoms. it's crucial to obtain a proper medical diagnosis. if the pain persists or becomes severe, you feel faint or dizzy, or you have symptoms such as fever or vomiting, seek immediate medical attention. these could be signs of a ruptured cyst or other serious condition.

but remember, only a healthcare provider can definitively diagnose the cause of your pain. please consult with your doctor if you're concerned."
Endo_64mvne_post,doc_prompt,"the pain you described could certainly be linked to an ovarian cyst. these cysts often cause unilateral (one-sided) pain in the lower abdomen, which can be sharp or dull. it can also, as you described, become worse with pressure. nausea can also be associated with larger cysts. pain might be intermittent or constant, and sometimes it can be mistaken for other issues such as endometriosis or kidney stones. if the cyst ruptures, the pain would likely significantly increase and be accompanied by swelling and possibly fever. given these symptoms and your existing endometriosis, i would strongly recommend you follow up with a healthcare provider to get a proper evaluation of your condition. note that sometimes, ovarian cysts may not present any symptoms and only discovered during routine check-ups or investigations for another issue."
Endo_64mvne_post,pat_prompt,"the pain you're describing could indeed be cyst-related. cysts often cause a sharp or dull persistent pain on the side where the cyst is located, typically made worse by pressure or even certain movements. additionally, nausea is another common symptom. however, pain can vary greatly from person to person, so what feels like a severe side stitch for you could be different for somebody else. it's important to not ignore new or worsening symptoms, as in some cases, persistent pain could indicate a ruptured cyst, which is a medical emergency. in your situation, it would be a good idea to reach out to your healthcare provider, describe what you experienced, and possibly arrange an examination or ultrasound scan to determine the cause of this unusual pain. remember, endometriosis can affect women differently, and what you're experiencing could be something else related to your endometriosis."
