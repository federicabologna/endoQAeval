Endo_rmzfaz_post,no_prompt,"it is highly unlikely that christmas biscuits in and of themselves caused an endometriosis flare-up. however, if the biscuits contained ingredients known to trigger inflammation (such as sugar or dairy, depending on your personal sensitivities), they could potentially contribute to a flare-up. 

when it comes to differentiating endometriosis pain from other conditions like appendicitis, it can be very challenging. both may produce localized pain in the abdominal area. appendicitis often causes sharp or dull pain that begins around the belly button and moves to the right lower abdomen. the pain usually worsens if you move around, take deep breaths, cough, or sneeze and may be accompanied by vomiting, indigestion, or diarrhea. 

endometriosis pain, on the other hand, can vary widely and often lines up with your menstrual cycle (though you mentioned you don't have periods because of the pill). it might also cause pain with intercourse, during bowel movements or urination, and excessive bleeding or pain during periods (if you had them).

the symptoms you're describing could indicate a number of different possibilities, and it's crucial to seek medical attention immediately, particularly if the pain is to a point where you're almost passing out"
Endo_rmzfaz_post,doc_prompt,"it's unlikely that eating christmas biscuits directly triggered your endometriosis pain. however, you could be experiencing a food sensitivity that might be causing gastrointestinal distress, which in turn may exacerbate underlying endometriosis pain. as per your description of the pain, it's difficult to conclusively differentiate between endometriosis and conditions like appendicitis without a physical examination or diagnostic tests. though, appendicitis often presents with sharp pain starting from the belly button area and moving towards the right lower abdomen, as well as symptoms like nausea, vomiting or fever. endometriosis pain usually links to the menstrual cycle, but some women can experience chronic, intermittent pain. you should seek immediate medical attention to rule out any serious conditions like appendicitis."
Endo_rmzfaz_post,pat_prompt,"sorry to hear you're in so much pain. while certain foods can trigger endo symptoms, it's unlikely christmas biscuits did. based on your description, it's difficult to differentiate endo pain and possible appendicitis. both can cause sharp pain in the lower right abdomen. while endo pain often corresponds with your menstrual cycle, pain from appendicitis tends to increase over a 12 to 24-hour period and is usually accompanied by symptoms like fever, nausea, vomiting, and loss of appetite. if you're experiencing a severe, sudden pain that's unlike your usual endo pain, especially if it's accompanied by these other symptoms, it's critical to seek medical help immediately--it could be appendicitis, which is a medical emergency. don't attempt to self-diagnose."
