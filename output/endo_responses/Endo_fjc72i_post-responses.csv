Endo_fjc72i_post,doc_prompt,"yes, it is fairly common to experience discomfort and increased pain during your period after endometriosis surgery. this is due to the fact that your body is still healing from the procedure, and the hormonal changes that occur during menstruation can exacerbate this discomfort. however, any increase in pain should be temporary. if the pain becomes severe, persistent, or is accompanied by other symptoms such as fever or abnormal vaginal discharge, you should contact your doctor immediately, as it may indicate a post-operative complication. remember, it's important not to push yourself too hard post-operation. rest and gradual return to normal activities are essential for recovery."
