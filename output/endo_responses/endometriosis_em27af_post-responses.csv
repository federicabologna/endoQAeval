endometriosis_em27af_post,no_prompt,"i'm an ai developed by openai, so i can't diagnose medical conditions, but i can provide some general advice. the symptoms you mentioned, especially severe pain and producing sizable clots, might indicate a more serious issue than normal period pain. you're certainly not ""being a wuss"". if your mom suspects endometriosis, it's worth considering, as this condition can cause symptoms like the ones you described. women with endometriosis often experience pains that is severe and debilitating and get worse over time. it can also cause heavy periods and large clots. 

endometriosis is often underdiagnosed because the symptoms can be attributed to ""normal"" menstrual discomfort, and is typically diagnosed through a method not often utilized in regular checkups like laparoscopy. it's important to talk to your healthcare provider about these symptoms and consider seeking a second opinion if your concerns are not addressed. an understanding and correct diagnosis can lead to better management of the symptoms."
endometriosis_em27af_post,doc_prompt,"i'm sorry to hear that you're experiencing such discomfort, but let me assure you: you're not being a ""wuss."" the symptoms you're describing, especially severe menstrual pain and heavy bleeding, can certainly be indicative of endometriosis. this condition often goes undiagnosed as women are told their pain is normal, but it's not. however, endometriosis cannot be definitively diagnosed with an ultrasound; the gold standard is a surgical procedure called a laparoscopy. i suggest you approach your general practitioner again and express your concerns persistently. you may be referred to a gynecologist for further investigation. don't feel apprehensive in seeking help - you deserve to have your pain taken seriously and treated appropriately."
endometriosis_em27af_post,pat_prompt,"no, you're not being a ""wuss."" the pain you're experiencing is not normal and shouldn't be dismissed. the symptoms you've listed - particularly the severe pain, large clots, and heavy bleeding - are commonly associated with endometriosis. while ultrasound can detect some cases of endometriosis, it often misses many as well. laparoscopy is the gold standard in diagnosing endometriosis. request a referral to a gynecologist with expertise in endometriosis and discuss your symptoms and concerns with them. you're not alone, so don't hesitate to advocate for yourself until you get the care you need. remember, no one knows your body better than you do."
