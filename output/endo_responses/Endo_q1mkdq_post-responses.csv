Endo_q1mkdq_post,pat_prompt,"i'm sorry to hear you're struggling with these side effects. it's crucial to talk to your healthcare provider about your current feelings of depression as well as any thoughts of suicide. the risks of serious harm must always be taken seriously. as for contraceptive options, progesterone-only pills can sometimes cause mood changes in sensitive individuals. however, other endometriosis treatments such as gnrh agonists and antagonists, or an iud device like mirena, may be alternatives to consider. 

staying away from coffee is a good idea as caffeine can exacerbate symptoms. it might also be helpful to consider additional non-hormonal treatments such as dietary changes, acupuncture, and pelvic physiotherapy which can be effective for many. 

this isn't a journey you have to navigate alone. connect with loved ones, a mental health professional, your doctor, and support groups for endometriosis. please reach out to a mental health professional immediately if you're feeling suicidal. your mental health is just as important as your physical health."
