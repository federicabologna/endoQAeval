Endo_q2gyms_post,no_prompt,"endometriosis can be a difficult condition to diagnose, manage, and fully understand, even among medical professionals. as such, some doctors may have different perspectives or experiences. there's considerable evidence to suggest that endometriosis pain may indeed fluctuate or ""flare"" at times, particularly in relation to the menstrual cycle. whether or not this can technically be called a ""flare up"" might be a matter of semantics. 

that being said, you know your body best, and it's incredibly important for healthcare providers to listen to, trust, and respect patients' experiences of their own bodies and symptoms. when in doubt, always consider seeking second opinions or switching healthcare providers if you don't feel heard, understood, or respected.

nonetheless, the doctor may also be trying to indicate that certain other diseases need to be ruled out, like gastrointestinal disorders which can also cause severe abdominal pain. to this end, the doctor is right for referring you to a gi specialist to rule out some other possible causes. 

keep in mind that you are the best advocate for your health. if youâ€™re not satisfied with how your complaints are addressed, you have every right to seek a second opinion. try to document your symptoms in as much detail as possible"
Endo_q2gyms_post,doc_prompt,"it sounds like you're having a tough time and i'm sorry to hear that. while it's true that endometriosis isn't typically described as ""flaring up"", pain can indeed intensify at times due to hormonal changes or other factors. the doctor's choice of words may just be a difference in terminology. however, your pain is very real and should be addressed. if the gynecologist doesn't think it's the endometriosis causing the pain, it's worth exploring other possible causes with a gi specialist as suggested. always listen to your body, and seek a second opinion if you feel it's necessary."
Endo_q2gyms_post,pat_prompt,"the doctor's dismissal of your pain flare-ups isn't necessarily a red flag, but it is a signal that you may need to communicate more clearly about your symptoms and have a deeper discussion about endometriosis. endo pain can sometimes feel like it's ""flaring up"", especially with hormonal changes throughout your cycle, but it's not a flare in the traditional sense like with autoimmune diseases. as for your current pain not being related to endo, it's possible since endo can often coexist with other conditions such as ibs, ic, etc. it's crucial to further investigate and not just assume it's endo. showing your doctor a pain/symptom diary could be helpful in discussing your situation more effectively. and remember, it's always okay to seek a second opinion if you feel uncomfortable or unheard."
