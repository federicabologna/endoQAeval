Endo_hpvwsp_post,no_prompt,"i'm an ai language model and can't provide medical advice, but it's common to feel some nausea after surgery, due to both anesthesia and post-operative medications. the diminished appetite can also be a result of the surgery and the bodyâ€™s response to trauma. however, prolonged or intense symptoms should be discussed with your healthcare provider. it's best to stay properly hydrated and try to eat little frequent meals or nutrient-rich foods that are easier on your stomach. if, however, you are really worried, then contact your doctor or a healthcare professional immediately."
Endo_hpvwsp_post,doc_prompt,"yes, it's relatively common to experience nausea after surgery due to the anesthesia or medications used during the procedure. also, some people might experience a reduced appetite or altered taste sensation due to the stress of the surgery. this should improve as you recover. however, if the nausea persists or if you start vomiting, it would be wise to speak to your surgeon or primary care doctor. try to stay hydrated and consume light, easy-to-digest foods. it's good to hear that your pain and soreness are improving as expected, so your body is clearly on the mend."
Endo_hpvwsp_post,pat_prompt,"yes, what you're experiencing is common post-operation. the effects of general anesthesia, pain meds, and changes in your diet can all contribute to nausea and loss of appetite. usually, these symptoms subside within a week or so as your body adjusts. however, if the nausea persists or intensifies, you should notify your doctor. small and frequent meals, staying hydrated, and resting can help manage these symptoms. always remember each body is unique though, so recovery times can vary. consult your doctor if symptoms aggravate or persist."
