endometriosis_oa06d8_post,no_prompt,"i'm an ai assistant and can't provide personal medical advice, but i can suggest that it's totally normal to be worried about a medical procedure, especially if there's a risk of complications. weighing risks and benefits is a key part of decision-making about treatment. if your endo specialist doctors believe the procedure can be done relatively safely, it may be worth considering their advice seriously.

untreated endometriosis can indeed worsen over time and possibly decrease fertility further. sometimes, surgeons are able to safely remove endometriosis tissue to increase the chances of pregnancy. additionally, leaving endometriosis untreated might not only impact your fertility but also your quality of life, as the disease can potentially cause more intense symptoms over time.

however, everyone's situation is different. you might consider getting a second opinion if you're unsure, or finding a healthcare professional who can help you talk through your concerns. some patients also find it helpful to talk with others who have gone through similar experiences, whether in online forums, support groups, etc."
endometriosis_oa06d8_post,doc_prompt,"your concerns are completely valid. your endometriosis nodule, though currently causing minimal symptoms, may impact your fertility if left untreated. thankfully, your surgeon appears to be well-versed in dealing with such nodules.

the potential for damage to the rectum, though possible, seems to be something your surgeon is prepared to address. this speaks to his experience and expertise. still, all surgeries carry risks, so your apprehension is understandable.

remember, untreated endometriosis can potentially progress and decrease ivf success rates. fertility specialists often recommend addressing endometriosis before starting an ivf cycle.

ultimately, you need to weigh your comfort with the surgery risks against your desire to enhance fertility and address the endometriosis. it is completely reasonable to seek a second opinion, or even counseling, to help you make this difficult decision. be open about your fears, and make sure all your questions are properly answered before you proceed."
endometriosis_oa06d8_post,pat_prompt,"your worries are completely normal when considering a surgery. while the complication your doctor mentioned could happen, it's important to remember that they're skilled and experienced, and wouldn't recommend the procedure if the risks outweighed the benefits. 

as for trying to conceive, studies have shown that endometriosis can indeed affect fertility and successful pregnancy rates, particularly when dealing with nodules in the recto-vaginal area. excising the endometriosis could potentially improve your chances of natural conception and the success rate of ivf if you later choose to undergo it. 

ultimately, the decision is deeply personal and depends on your comfort with the risk of complications, your desire to potentially mitigate pain and improve fertility, and your trust in your doctor. though it's a tough decision to make, just know that your feelings are shared by many others who have experienced something similar. discuss with your doctor further if you still have apprehensions."
