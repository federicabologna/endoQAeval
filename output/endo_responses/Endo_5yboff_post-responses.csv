Endo_5yboff_post,no_prompt,"i'm an ai and not a doctor, but i can tell you that cyclic pelvic pain is often associated with conditions such as endometriosis or recurrent ovarian cysts. endometriomas are a type of endometriosis where cysts form on your ovaries, which could potentially rupture, causing sudden and intense pain.

adhesions behind the uterus might also cause discomfort or pain, particularly during a menstrual cycle. the adhesions are bands of scar tissue that can bind organs together, potentially interfering with their normal function and movement, causing discomfort.

additionally, mittelschmerz is a term used to describe pain that can occur during the time of ovulation. this is another potential cause, although typically this pain is more mid-cycle as you mentioned.

again, these are potential causes and none of this information substitutes for a personal consultation with a healthcare professional. it might be best to consult with a reproductive endocrinologist or a gynecologist who specializes in endometriosis. a laparoscopy could provide more definitive answers."
Endo_5yboff_post,doc_prompt,"yes, endometriomas can indeed cause such pain. endometriosis can lead to the formation of endometriomas, which are cysts that can occur in your ovaries. the severe pain you are describing could indicate a ruptured endometrioma, which can feel very similar to a cyst rupture. 

they are most common during menstruation, but can occur any time within the menstrual cycle. the fact that you continue to experience this severe pain indicates it is something that requires further investigation, because it's also possible the adhesions you mentioned are causing some of this pain. 

a laparoscopy can diagnose if it's endometriosis or not and, depending on its extent, it may be treated during the same procedure. if an ovarian cyst or endometrioma can be confirmed, hormonal treatment might be useful despite your wish to conceive. a multi-disciplinary approach involving a pain specialist and a fertility specialist might also be of help. 

in conclusion, your symptoms warrant further evaluation. don't hesitate to advocate for your care."
Endo_5yboff_post,pat_prompt,"it sounds like you're dealing with ovarian endometriomas, also known as ""chocolate cysts"". they can cause severe pain, especially during menstruation or ovulation. these types of cysts can occur anywhere in the body, but most commonly they are found in the ovaries. they consist of endometrial tissue and can grow, shrink, or even rupture, which can lead to significant pain. 

birth control is often prescribed to manage endometriomas but as you mentioned, this is not an option if you're trying to conceive. surgery can be an alternative treatment but carries the risk of damaging healthy ovarian tissue. 

as you've noted, the sharpness and duration of the pain are a concern. i would recommend seeking out a specialist in endometriosis or a reproductive endocrinologist who has experience with endometriosis patients. a different doctor might take a different approach and offer more solutions. also, let them know about the frequency and severity of your pain, as this will be important information in finding the right treatment for you."
