Endo_o7k22x_post,no_prompt,"lupron is a drug that significantly reduces hormone levels, therefore you can experience physical and emotional changes in the first days to weeks after starting treatment. this is often known as the ""flare effect."" fatigue, mood changes, feeling disconnected are common side effects of lupron as it impacts your hormone levels. 

your body is adjusting to a new hormonal environment and it can take time to stabilize. it could indeed be a result of the temporary increase of estrogen. lupron works by overstimulating the body's own production of certain hormones, which temporarily causes an increase before causing a significant reduction.

however, since you've noted a sudden and severe change in your energy levels and mood, you should contact your healthcare provider to discuss these side-effects and ensure it's a normal response to the treatment. everyoneâ€™s body responds differently to medication and it's essential for your medical team to be aware of how you're feeling. they can offer guidance, reassurance, modify your dosage or consider other medication options if these side effects continue to be a significant concern. your health, comfort, and well-being should always come first."
Endo_o7k22x_post,doc_prompt,"yes, what you're experiencing is not uncommon with lupron. lupron acts by initially causing a temporary surge in estrogen before leading to a significant reduction in sex hormones levels. this hormone fluctuation can be accompanied by a variety of side effects such as fatigue, mood swings, or feeling 'disconnected,' as you described. 

however, these side effects should gradually improve as your body adjusts to the medication. if they persist or become severe, it's crucial to notify your prescriber immediately. it may take some time for your body to regulate, but managing side effects is key so you can stay as comfortable as possible throughout the transition. keep consistent communication with your healthcare provider to ensure you're on the right track."
Endo_o7k22x_post,pat_prompt,"yes, your symptoms are fairly normal and may be due to the initial estrogen surge that can occur after starting lupron. this drug works by suppressing the production of estrogen in the body, but it can initially cause a temporary increase in these hormones. that's because lupron first stimulates the release of fsh and lh hormones from the brain, which then leads to a boost in estrogen production. this temporary surge can lead to worsening of symptoms before improvement is noticed, often called a ""flare"" period. 

these symptoms should subside after 1-2 weeks as your estrogen levels drop. however, everyone's response to medication is unique, and if these effects persist or become intolerable, it's essential to consult your healthcare provider. they may be able to adjust your dosage or explore other treatment options."
