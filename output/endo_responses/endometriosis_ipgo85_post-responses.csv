endometriosis_ipgo85_post,no_prompt,"taking two birth control pills in one day shouldn't cause any immediate harm, although it might slightly increase your chances of light side effects like nausea or headache. pain, however, isn't generally a predicted symptom following a missed dose, especially if it's severe or prolonged. 

if you're experiencing unusual pain, it might not be related to doubling up on your birth control pill. if the pain continues, you should definitely contact your healthcare provider and let them know the situation. as in all medical matters, when in doubt, always seek professional medical advice."
endometriosis_ipgo85_post,doc_prompt,"accidentally taking an extra birth control pill shouldn't cause significant concern. these pills mainly contain hormones estrogen and progesterone, and a one-time double dose generally doesn't lead to serious symptoms. however, it can sometimes cause temporary side effects including nausea, mild headache or slight hormonal imbalance, which might explain your increase in pain. if the extra pain is related to your endometriosis, make sure to stay hydratated, use warm compresses, and consider over-the-counter pain medications. if you notice any severe symptoms or if the pain persists for a longer period, please see your doctor or gynaecologist for an evaluation. make sure to continue taking the rest of your birth control pills as usual."
endometriosis_ipgo85_post,pat_prompt,"while i'm not a doctor, my own experiences with endometriosis and birth control may provide some context to your situation. accidentally doubling up on a birth control pill could potentially result in some temporary side effects like nausea, breast tenderness, or headaches - additional pain could possibly be part of these short term side effects. it should settle down after a few days once your body adjusts to the initial surge in hormones, however, it's important to return to your normal dosage without skipping any pills. if the pain continues or is severe, contacting your doctor would be a good idea to rule out any other potential issues contributing to your pain. it's unlikely to have serious consequences but it's always best to have professional medical advice when symptoms change or worsen."
