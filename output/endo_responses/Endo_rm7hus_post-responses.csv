Endo_rm7hus_post,doc_prompt,"your symptoms of severe menstrual cramps, extended periods, tiredness, lower back pain, and disruption of normal activities are concerning. while these could be related to endometriosis, they could also be indicative of several other conditions, including adenomyosis, fibroids, pelvic inflammatory disease, or certain hormonal imbalances. period pain isn't something you should 'learn to live with'. it's important to have a detailed discussion with your doctor, who may suggest a pelvic exam, ultrasound, or other tests for an accurate diagnosis. anxiety can worsen perceptions of pain, so addressing this might also help improve your situation. remember, seeking medical advice is never embarrassing - it's an important step towards feeling better."
Endo_rm7hus_post,pat_prompt,"i'm not a doctor but as you said, it's essential to get a medical professional's opinion. your symptoms could indicate endometriosis, but they could also be related to other conditions such as polycystic ovary syndrome (pcos), fibroids, or adenomyosis. these often present with painful, heavy or irregular periods, fatigue, and can also cause anxiety or depression. you might also have developed a resistance to the birth control, or it's just not suitable for you. hormonal imbalance could be another possible cause. remember, it's never a waste of time to look out for your health, and it's not a failure if your diagnosis isn't endometriosis. the important thing is finding a solution to your pain and other symptoms. don't let the fear of embarrassment stop you from pursuing help. it's your health and well-being at stake, and any good doctor would take your concerns seriously. it may also be useful to consult with a mental health professional for your anxiety. don't hesitate to reach out for help when you need it."
