Endo_omflm3_post,no_prompt,"while there isn't extensive scientific literature connecting endometriosis and pernicious anemia directly, there is some support for the idea that the two could potentially be related due to the presence of autoimmune factors. both endometriosis and pernicious anemia are believed to potentially have autoimmune components.

endometriosis is thought by some healthcare professionals to possibly be an autoimmune response. while not officially classified as an autoimmune disease, certain autoimmune disease markers have been found in higher levels in those with endometriosis. 

pernicious anemia is an autoimmune condition, as you mentioned. it's caused by the immune system destroying cells in your stomach that help you absorb vitamin b12. 

if you're experiencing menopause due to your endometriosis treatment, that could potentially be affecting your body's ability to absorb b12, leading to pernicious anemia. however, this would be something to discuss with your healthcare provider, as it's a complex issue and more research would be needed.

it's also important to note that both endometriosis and pernicious anemia are more common in afab individuals, potentially indicating some sort of connection even if it's not fully understood yet.

pcos, on the"
Endo_omflm3_post,doc_prompt,"current medical research does not establish a direct link between endometriosis and pernicious anemia. endometriosis is a condition involving the growth of uterine lining outside the uterus and pernicious anemia is an inability to absorb vitamin b12, leading to its deficiency. both may have autoimmune factors, but they are distinct conditions. however, having one autoimmune condition could potentially increase the risk of developing another. the manifestations you are experiencing could be due to a combination of specific factors unique to your physiological makeup and not necessarily a generalizable occurrence. continuous research is ongoing about these conditions individually and together. it is advisable to consult with a specialist to manage both conditions effectively."
Endo_omflm3_post,pat_prompt,"while research on the link between endometriosis and pernicious anemia is limited, there is some evidence that autoimmune disorders may occur together more frequently than we'd expect by chance. that being said, the exact relationship is far from understood and the existence of one disorder doesn't necessarily lead to the other. it's also important to consider that individuals taking visanne might experience symptoms that mimic menopause, but it's not the same as biological menopause. your b12 deficiency could potentially stem from another source unrelated to your endo or pa. it seems further testing and consultation with a new ob-gyn (once you're able to do so) would be a good move forward. it can be frustrating dealing with one health problem after another, but knowing you're not alone can be a source of comfort."
