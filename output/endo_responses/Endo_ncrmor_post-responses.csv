Endo_ncrmor_post,no_prompt,"i'm not a doctor, but i can suggest that you should consult with a healthcare professional about your situation. after a laparoscopic surgery (lap), it can vary between individuals how long it is before they get their appetite back fully or if they experience food aversions. this could be due to numerous reasons like the type of surgery, personal recovery rate, reaction to anesthesia, or even post-operative medications. speak to your doctor about your symptoms, especially since it involves nausea, inability to stomach certain foods, and subsequent migraines. they might recommend a dietitian to help manage your food intake during your recovery. however, this advice is only informational and should not replace professional medical advice."
Endo_ncrmor_post,doc_prompt,"a decrease in appetite following surgery could be a normal part of the recovery process, but it should steadily improve over time. your sustained lack of appetite and associated feelings of nausea are concerning, especially given that it’s over a month post-operation. while the underlying cause could be several things - pain medication side effects, residual anesthetics, a slower-than-average return to normal gastrointestinal function - it warrants a medical evaluation. i strongly suggest getting in touch with your surgeon or a healthcare provider to discuss these symptoms as soon as possible. they may want to conduct tests to rule out any surgical complications or other medical conditions. in the meantime, continue to stay hydrated, and try to consume small, frequent meals comprised of foods that you can tolerate."
Endo_ncrmor_post,pat_prompt,"while not everyone experiences the same symptoms post-laparoscopy, loss of appetite can occur, but should only last a few days. your prolonged symptoms might be due to a change in diet or emotional stress more than a direct result of the operation. still, you should contact your doctor about this. there might be a need for dietary adjustment or treatment for potential complications like infections. when you can tolerate only certain types of food, it may indicate some types of food intolerance. health professionals such as dietitians or gastroenterologists can assist you with this. remember, it's crucial to nourish your body well, especially while it’s healing. don't force yourself to eat things that make you feel unwell, but also don't rely on unhealthy foods. aim for a balanced diet rich in protein, vitamins, and minerals."
