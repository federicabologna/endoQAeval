Endo_kxtvri_post,no_prompt,"i'm an ai language model, not a doctor, but i can tell you what is generally true about these things. endometriomas, also known as 'chocolate cysts', are a form of endometriosis where a type of cyst forms on the ovaries. they generally can be detected with an mri or ultrasound. however, smaller lesions or early stages of the disease may not always be visible on imaging tests. always consult your healthcare provider for any health concerns."
Endo_kxtvri_post,doc_prompt,"endometriomas, which are cysts caused by endometriosis, typically do show up on an mri. however, diagnosis of endometriosis can be challenging since other conditions may mimic its symptoms, and imaging might not always reveal smaller lesions. adhesions can also cause pain, even in areas not directly corresponding to the location of the adhesions. pain perceived in a different location than the actual problem area is known as ""referred pain"". therefore, even though your mri shows no nodules at the exact location of your pain, the adhesions elsewhere could still be the source of your discomfort. given your symptoms, it is recommended to share these concerns with your gynecologist so they can monitor you closely for potential endometriosis or other conditions."
Endo_kxtvri_post,pat_prompt,"yes, generally, an endometrioma (a type of cyst formed when endometrial tissue grows in the ovaries) would show up on an mri. however, small endometriomas or adhesions may not always be visible. also, endometriosis is a complex condition and can cause pain even without visible signs on scans. pain severity is not necessarily related to disease stage or imaging results. the adhesions you mentioned could be triggering this pain, even if they're not exactly on the spot where you feel it. remember, i'm a patient myself, not a doctor, but if this pain continues, i strongly recommend following up with your physician or a specialist in endometriosis. they might have more insight into your symptoms and next potential steps, which could include laparoscopic surgery for diagnosis or pain management strategies."
