endometriosis_pp6l2o_post,no_prompt,"bloating or swelling, often referred to as ""endobelly,"" can occur in people with endometriosis, but it doesn't necessarily cause the muscles to separate. the severe bloating that can sometimes occur with endometriosis is usually due to inflammation and fluid buildup. 

diastasis recti is a condition where the large abdominal muscles separate. it's commonly seen in pregnant or postpartum women, but it can also occur in anyone due to improper exercises, heavy lifting, or rapid weight gain. while it's not directly caused by endometriosis, severe and chronic bloating might potentially exacerbate an existing condition like diastasis recti. always consult with your healthcare provider if you're experiencing any unusual physical changes."
