endometriosis_k0kujj_post,no_prompt,"pain during sex (dyspareunia) associated with endometriosis doesn't always present itself in the form of cramping. it can indeed manifest as a burning sensation, as well as deep, sharp, or stabbing pain. the pain can occur during or after sexual intercourse. it's important to remember that everyone's experience with endometriosis is different, and the type and severity of symptoms can vary greatly.

the burning pain you are experiencing may also be due to your diagnosed pelvic dysfunction, as this can cause a variety of uncomfortable symptoms. pelvic floor dysfunction can lead to a variety of conditions that cause pain during sex, such as vaginismus (involuntary muscle contractions of the pelvic floor muscles), vulvodynia (chronic vulvar pain), or pelvic inflammatory disease.

topical estrogen creams, pelvic floor therapies, biofeedback and other treatments might be an option to reduce these symptoms. if you haven't already, i'd recommend discussing these symptoms with your healthcare provider to find the best treatment for your individual situation."
endometriosis_k0kujj_post,doc_prompt,"endometriosis can cause different types of pain, including during intercourse. while cramping is common, it can also be manifested as a deep, aching pain or a sharp, burning pain. the pain you're describing at the start of the vagina could be due to endometriosis lesions, other types of pelvic dysfunction, or even another condition such as vulvodynia or vaginitis. it's important to discuss these symptoms with your doctor, who may suggest further investigation or treatment options to help manage the pain, such as topical pain relievers or pelvic floor therapy."
endometriosis_k0kujj_post,pat_prompt,"no, pain from endometriosis during sex doesn't necessarily have to be cramping. endometriosis-related pain can present in many ways and may differ among individuals. the burning pain you described could be linked to endometriosis, especially if endometrial lesions are near or involving the vaginal canal. however, it could also be associated with your pelvic dysfunction or even other conditions like vulvodynia or vaginitis. even though lube helps, you should raise these concerns to your gynaecologist. they can provide more personalized advice, further tests if needed, and can help manage your symptoms more effectively."
