endometriosis_965x9r_post,no_prompt,"changes in bowel function can be a sign of endometriosis, particularly if it's located on or near the bowel. however, the specific symptom of not feeling a need to have a bowel movement isn't commonly discussed in relation to endometriosis. that being said, everybody is unique and so are the ways in which their bodies respond to conditions like endometriosis. it's also possible that this is a secondary symptom related to reduced activity, anxiety, or changes in diet or medication. 

ideally, these changes should be communicated with your healthcare provider. as you're awaiting surgery, it will be helpful to provide your surgeon with as much information as possible about any changes you've been experiencing. also, endometriosis can sometimes cause complications like bowel or bladder problems, usually if the disease is at an advanced stage or if the patient has deep infiltrating endometriosis, which is a severe form of the disease, but these are relatively rare. 

please consult with your healthcare provider as soon as possible to discuss this change. this will help map out the next steps to take to potentially rectify your situation."
endometriosis_965x9r_post,doc_prompt,"endometriosis can potentially invade many organs within the pelvic area, including the bowel, and can potentially cause altered bowel habits. while lack of sensation before a bowel movement isn't a typical symptom of endometriosis on the bowel, every woman's experience with endometriosis is unique. the increased pain you're experiencing could be a signal of bowel involvement, as conversely, bowel endometriosis can often result in painful bowel movements. i would recommend discussing these symptoms with your surgeon or gynecologist before your operation. they may consider a further examination or altered surgical approach if bowel involvement is suspected."
endometriosis_965x9r_post,pat_prompt,"yes, what you're experiencing could be related to endometriosis on the bowel, known as bowel endometriosis. it can cause symptoms like changes in bowel habits, painful bowel movements, or in some cases, loss of regular sensation of needing to go. this is due to the disease affecting the nerves in the bowel. however, other conditions can cause similar symptoms, so it's important to discuss your symptoms with your doctor. they may perform tests or refer you to a specialist for further evaluation to confirm the cause. even if diarrhoea occurs rarely, it is worth mentioning to your healthcare provider. managing these symptoms can improve your quality of life significantly."
