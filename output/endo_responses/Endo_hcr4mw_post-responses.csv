Endo_hcr4mw_post,doc_prompt,"i'm sorry to hear you're struggling with these symptoms. it's important to clarify that this is not normal. while endometriosis can indeed result in severe pain, it typically does not cause fainting spells. the severity of your symptoms suggests that you may be dealing with something more complex. it could still be a manifestation of endo, especially if you suspect diaphragmatic involvement which can affect breathing and cause referred shoulder pain. however, fainting and such severe abdominal pain could indicate other potential issues. 

regarding your specific endometriosis questions, these misplaced cells can bleed during your period. they can also cause inflammation and form scar tissue. the blood generally gets reabsorbed by the body, but this process can exacerbate inflammation and pain.

your symptoms and the blood in your stool might point to a digestive issue or a potential overlap with gastrointestinal disorders. connecting with a healthcare professional is essential to get a thorough evaluation.

i understand your concerns and fears, especially about surgical intervention, but remember that untreated endometriosis can lead to worsening symptoms and potential fertility concerns. please, do not delay seeking help."
Endo_hcr4mw_post,pat_prompt,"based on your symptoms, it definitely sounds like endometriosis of the diaphragm, and severe at that. however, a diagnosis can only be confirmed by a medical professional. regarding your spells of fainting and other extreme symptoms, while these can occasionally be associated with severe endometriosis, it's not common or considered â€œnormal"". this definitely needs medical attention.

leaving endometriosis untreated can lead to worsening symptoms and potential long-term complications, such as infertility, and notably, the endometriotic tissues can indeed bleed.

in regard to your question about the blood, it often stays in the surrounding area, leading to inflammation and pain. it can also lead to the formation of cysts and scar tissue.

as for your kidney infection and blood in the stool, these might be related, but could also be independent issues. it would be best to get them checked out as well.

i know that going to the doctor is stressful, but i strongly recommend that you seek medical help. you need a diagnosis so you can start appropriate treatment. don't be afraid to advocate for yourself. your wellbeing is worth it."
