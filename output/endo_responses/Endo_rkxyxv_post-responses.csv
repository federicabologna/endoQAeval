Endo_rkxyxv_post,no_prompt,"i'm an ai language model and not a doctor, but i can share that some of the symptoms you're experiencing, especially the pain and period irregularity, are associated with endometriosis. however, they could also be symptoms of several other conditions, so it's important to continue seeking advice from medical professionals. 

endometriosis is a difficult condition to diagnose because it often mimics the symptoms of other conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome (ibs), gastrointestinal issues, or even ovarian cysts. therefore, it's sometimes referred to as ""the great imitator."" 

many women with endometriosis do have painful menstruation or pain during intercourse, but this isn't true in every case. bloating, changes in bowel habits, and stomach pain can also be related to endometriosis. 

however, an official diagnosis of endometriosis typically is confirmed through a procedure called a laparoscopy, a small surgery where the doctor looks inside your abdomen for signs of endometriosis. 

it's understandable to feel frustrated being dismissed by doctors. if possible, you could seek a second opinion, preferably from a gynaecologist who specialises in endometriosis. if it is"
Endo_rkxyxv_post,doc_prompt,"your symptoms could be suggestive of endometriosis, especially since you are experiencing significant pain which increases with your periods and digestive issues. the change in period blood color and consistency also could signify menstrual irregularities, which are common in endometriosis. furthermore, the fact that your symptoms haven't improved with dietary changes or birth control (which sometimes can help in mild endometriosis), suggests that it may be a good idea to further investigate this possibility.

however, endometriosis can only be definitively diagnosed through a laparoscopy, which is a surgical procedure. i recommend you to consult with a gynecologist who specializes in endometriosis. it is important to emphasize the impact this is having on your quality of life and push for more thorough investigation, especially since endometriosis is a condition that is often initially overlooked or misdiagnosed. do not let your symptoms to be dismissed, as untreated endometriosis may lead to further complications. your concerns are valid, and they deserve to be addressed appropriately."
Endo_rkxyxv_post,pat_prompt,"your symptoms do overlap with those commonly associated with endometriosis, particularly the menstrual irregularities, pain during tampon insertion, and chronic bloating. endometriosis can often be misdiagnosed or dismissed initially. it's also important to note that endometriosis can't typically be confirmed through the tests you've had done â€” it's most accurately diagnosed through a diagnostic laparoscopy. this is a minor surgical procedure where a thin scope is inserted into the pelvic area for observation.

i strongly advise you to find a gynecologist specializing in endometriosis to discuss your symptoms and, if agreed by both of you after a thorough evaluation, consider a diagnostic laparoscopy. it can be frustrating and mentally draining to search for a diagnosis, but self-advocacy is key in managing this. while no online advice or self-diagnosis can substitute professional medical opinion, remember, you're not alone. many of us have gone through similar experiences."
