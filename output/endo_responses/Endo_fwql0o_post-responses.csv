Endo_fwql0o_post,no_prompt,"i'm not a doctor but i can share some general information which might help, based on what you've described. your gynecologist's course of action does generally align with common approaches to treating a thickened endometrium (lining of the uterus). aygestin is often prescribed to help reduce the thickness of the endometrium and regulate heavy, prolonged periods, but it can cause side effects such as mood changes, upset stomach, and cramps.

fibroids and polycystic ovary syndrome (pcos) are indeed quite different, but it's not uncommon for women to have both. both can influence menstrual irregularities and heavy bleeding. if a fibroid is found in your uterine lining, treatment options depend upon its size, location, and whether it's causing symptoms. surgical intervention might be necessary if it's causing significant issues. the procedure can range from minimally invasive to more complex depending on these factors.

endometriosis, on the other hand, is often misdiagnosed as other conditions due to the similar symptoms it shares with other gynecological disorders. your experience of life-long messy periods could indicate this condition, but of course, only a medical professional can make that determination based on their"
Endo_fwql0o_post,doc_prompt,"it's difficult to diagnose conditions online, as they often require tests. thickening of the uterine lining can be due to fibroids, adenomyosis, polyps, or endometrial hyperplasia - so it's quite wide-ranging. aygestin is commonly used to shed the thickened lining, making ultrasonography more accurate. side effects can include mood changes, bloating, and cramps, which could be what you're experiencing. 

pcos and endometriosis can coexist but the issues you mention aren't specific to pcos alone. if you're not improving with aygestin or if the side effects are too bothersome, i recommend a follow-up visit to discuss options with your gynecologist.

as for surgery, fibroid removal often involves either a hysteroscopic resection, a myomectomy, or - in severe cases - a hysterectomy, but it will depend on the size and location of the fibroid. discuss any concerns with your doctor to understand your condition better. always remember, getting a second opinion can provide peace of mind if you're feeling skeptical."
Endo_fwql0o_post,pat_prompt,"i'm sorry to hear what you're going through. it's hard to say definitively without a proper diagnosis but aygestin is used to treat endometriosis, menstrual disorders, and secondary amenorrhea. the side effects like hormonal changes and cramps you mention are unfortunately common. 

it's possible for pcos to cause thickened uterine lining, but your symptoms could also indicate conditions like uterine fibroids, polyps, or endometriosis, which involve abnormal tissue growth. 

you're right to want to rule out endometriosis. it can cause irregular periods, pain, and spotting. endometriosis can only be definitively diagnosed via laparoscopy, so if your symptoms continue, you might wish to discuss this further with your doctor.

remember, it's ok to question, seek out second opinions, and demand for the correct diagnosis and treatment plan for you. please remember everyone's medical situation is different, so what worked for me or others might not work for you."
