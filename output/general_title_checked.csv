0,N19,xy6ur0,"First T/C seizure, then first migraine less than 3 weeks later? So, on September 17 I (21F) had an unprovoked, tonic clonic seizure. The morning of, I woke up at 7am to a bad headache above my right eye that was also on the back of my head on the left side. I had some snacks thinking it might be hunger, no improvement. I later took 600mg ibuprofen, also no improvement. I was putting in an earring (which I‰Ûªve never had a problem with shots, piercings, excision biopsies, etc and i was not nervous or had locked knees or w/e) and after putting it in I immediately got dizzy with tunnel vision. Luckily, my boyfriend was there and held onto me, as I have fainted before and could tell it was coming. I went unconscious seconds after he grabbed me. This is where I know it wasn‰Ûªt fainting: He said my body stiffened and I was still standing while unconscious, I let out a groan, and then mainly my upper body began convulsing. He laid me down in the hallway and the convulsions calmed down. He said at that point my face was turning blue and he thought I needed CPR, so he began compressions. By the third one, I was waking up as if from a deep sleep, and tried to shove him off as if I wanted 5 more minutes. The first thing I could think was how sore I was, as if I went to the gym the day before. I hadn‰Ûªt opened my eyes yet or tried to speak, my hearing seemed muffled. Then I opened my eyes and was able to begin talking within a couple seconds. I had immediate, intense anxiety and was extremely exhausted, also crying for no reason? maybe fear? My headache was also much worse. This has never happened to me and as much as I wanted it to just be fainting, I know its not. I‰Ûªve fainted a handful of times in my life and it‰Ûªs never had any other events/symptoms like this did. I didn‰Ûªt know i was supposed to go to the ER, because I didn‰Ûªt realize it was a seizure. But I told a telehealth Dr what happened and they said it was a tonic-clonic seizure. I went to a NP at my physician office and she just won‰Ûªt believe me and said i just fainted. So i feel discouraged.
Yesterday, 10/6, I had my first migraine. It began an hour after waking (~10am) above my right eye near my hairline. By 5pm the whole right side of my face hurt, I had intense sound/light sensitivity, felt dazed, dizzy, lightheaded, muffled hearing, ear pressure, and had some vision changes like blurs/lights. It has also followed into today, 10/07.
My parents and the NP have discouraged me of my own experiences and it‰Ûªs making me feel crazy for thinking this needs to be checked out. I just need a professional to hear this and hopefully give me insight. I don‰Ûªt want to find out it‰Ûªs too late if I don‰Ûªt do anything, but my family has always treated me as if i‰Ûªm faking illnesses, even though i never have and have never been dramatic in any way. please help. i‰Ûªm still on their insurance, so that‰Ûªs why it‰Ûªs important.

thank you.

Please and thank you.",response_N19,"i'm sorry to hear about what you're going through. your symptoms are definitely something that warrants medical attention. 

while your first experience does seem like it could possibly have been a tonic-clonic seizure, it's difficult to say for sure without having seen it and without any further testing. headache, stiffness, groaning, convulsions, and postictal (post-seizure) confusion and fatigue are common in such seizures, but they can also be symptoms of other conditions.

regarding your second experience, migraines can cause a host of different symptoms, and many of the ones you mentioned (head pain, sound/light sensitivity, dizziness, vision changes, etc.) are common. 

however, given that this is the first time you're experiencing these symptoms and their severity, you should definitely seek a second medical opinion, preferably a neurologist or a headache specialist who can help shed more light on your condition. 

moreover, the relationship between seizures and migraines is complex and not fully understood, but they can coexist and even resemble each other in some cases, with migraines sometimes causing seizure-like symptoms and vice versa.

don't let anyone, including your family or an np, discourage you from seeking help and taking your","i'm really sorry to hear about your experience - that must be very distressing, especially with the feeling of not being taken seriously. while i'm not a doctor and this definitely isn't a replacement for professional medical advice, i can share a few things.

1. given the severity and sudden onset of your symptoms, i strongly encourage you to seek a second opinion - ideally from a neurologist. a tonic-clonic seizure (if that's what it was) is generally regarded as a significant medical event that warrants investigation by an appropriate specialist.

2. it does sound like your symptoms might be indicative of something neurological. some types of headaches and migraines can be associated with seizures or similar neurological events.

3. it's important to stand up for your health, especially when you're feeling unheard. your concerns are valid and i'd encourage you to share them with another healthcare provider who is willing to work with you on figuring out what's going on.

please seek an immediate evaluation if you experience any severe symptoms or have another event like the one you described."

Any reason why that might be happening?",response_N36,"changes in frequency and consistency of bowel movements can occur due to a number of reasons including changes in diet, stress, and medication. smoking, caffeine (from coffee), and some medications can act as stimulants and could potentially increase the frequency of bowel movements. additionally, stress or changes in routine (such as not working) could also cause changes in bowel habits. if you notice persistent excessive bowel movements, severe changes in stool consistency, accompanying signs of blood or mucus in stool, or any other concerning symptoms, it would be best to consult with a healthcare professional. this could indicate more serious conditions like inflammatory bowel disease or infections which needs proper medical evaluation and treatment.","there could be a few potential reasons why your bowel habits are changing. diet and lifestyle can greatly impact your digestive health - if you're eating differently or exercising less when you're not working, this could potentially explain the change. 

stress can also have an impact on digestion and bowel movements. if you're experiencing more stress or anxiety when you're not working, it could be causing your digestive system to speed up, leading to more frequent bowel movements.

smoking and caffeine can also stimulate the digestive system and may cause more frequent bowel movements.

however, if you're noticing that you're passing very watery stools frequently throughout the day, it could be an indication of an infection or other medical condition like irritable bowel syndrome or crohn's disease, and it would be a good idea to speak to a doctor. it's especially important to seek medical advice if you're experiencing other symptoms like significant weight loss, change in stool color, blood in stool, fever, or severe abdominal pain."

What should i do now? I dont want to take antibiotics again.",response_N38,"i'm an ai language model, but i can provide some general advice on this situation. it sounds like you've been having recurrent urinary tract infections (utis), which could be due to various reasons. repeated antibiotic use can indeed lead to resistance and potentially more problems in the long run.

however, it's crucial to visit your doctor or a specialist (like a urologist) to discuss your symptoms and medical history. they might want to conduct more tests to identify any underlying issues. for example, they could check for abnormalities in your urinary system that might promote utis, or consider other potential causes of your symptoms.

in the meantime, drinking plenty of water and urinating frequently may help, as this can flush bacteria out of your system. avoiding irritants (like bubble bath or harsh soaps in the genital area), emptying your bladder before and after sexual intercourse, and wiping from front to back after using the toilet can also help prevent utis.

remember, medical advice should always be personalized, and your healthcare provider is the best person to speak to. it's particularly important not to self-diagnose or self-treat with antibiotics without medical supervision because this can lead to antibiotic resistance, which makes infections harder to treat","recurrent utis can be really frustrating to deal with. it's important to ensure these aren't just symptoms of another underlying condition. while you might not want to take more antibiotics, repeated infections often need to be treated with them to ensure full recovery so the bacteria does not become resistant. 

lifestyle changes can help prevent uti. drink plenty of water to flush out bacteria; avoid holding back when you need to pee; wipe from front to back after using the toilet to prevent bacteria from the anal area spreading to the urethra; pee before and after sex; don’t use irritating feminine products; and wear cotton underwear, and loose fitting clothes so air can keep the area dry. 

if you're getting frequent utis, your doctor might ask for an ultrasound or a cystoscopy to look into your bladder; schedule regular follow-up tests to ensure infections have cleared up; recommend a longer course of antibiotics; or provide a prescription for antibiotics to be taken as soon as symptoms of a uti being. 

in some instances, the recurrent utis could also be due to your partner not being fully treated. i strongly suggest discussing this with your healthcare provider so they can provide the best possible care."

the movement of your breast when you move your index finger may indicate ""synkinesis,"" which is when recovery of one nerve is associated with unintended movement in another area of the body. this can occur when nerves regrow following a nerve graft surgery but end up 'cross wiring.' this is typically managed through physical therapy or botulinum toxin injections.

however, all of this should be evaluated by a healthcare professional. if these symptoms started only a few months ago they might indicate changes in your nerve function following the surgery you had as an infant. you should make an appointment with a neurologist for an evaluation. they may order some diagnostic tests like emg, nerve conduction studies, or mri to evaluate your nerve function. in general, changes in sensation, movement, or pain in an area of previous nerve damage should be evaluated by a healthcare professional.

5,N63,xttd8l,"23M - Colon cancer? Hi there, I've been noticing some strange things with myself lately, and doing a quick search online lead me to suggestions that I might have colon cancer. If this is the case, I can't afford treatment, let alone a doctors visit. Here's  what's been going on though, and apologies for TMI. 

3 or maybe 4 months ago, I noticed that I was pooping less frequently. My diets not the best (cheap junk food and bad balance in general), so I'm no stranger to constipation. So it wasn't anything new. When I was pooping though, and still to this day, the smell is this sickening weird death smell that I haven't had before until now, and the same thing for passing gas. No blood though, or any serious stomach pains which I read is a possible symptom of colon cancer. 

This smell though goes beyond that, and I am constantly smelling it while just passively breathing in. I thought maybe I have some kind of infection somewhere? Besides this though, I've been feeling more tired than normal. I'm an avid coffee drinker so I tried more coffee and that didn't help. No coffee at all, and I felt exactly the same somehow. I'll take a nap and wake up tired. Thought it could be vitamin deficiency but I'm always outside and taking b12s and all that. 

Idk. It would be simple for me to just get looked at because something's clearly up, but I dont't have the finances for anything like chemotherapy or a colonoscopy. If anyone has some words I would definitely appreciate it.","Hi there, I've been noticing some strange things with myself lately, and doing a quick search online lead me to suggestions that I might have colon cancer.

if your symptoms rapidly worsen, or if you start having high fever, severe pain, vertigo (dizziness, balance problems), or decreased hearing, these could be indicators of a more serious infection or potential complications and you should seek emergency medical care.

also, if your symptoms persist for more than 1-3 days, it would be wise to reach out to your healthcare provider again, as you might need a different kind of antibiotic, and/or other treatments to tackle your ear infection more effectively. your doctor may also wish to evaluate if any intervention to relieve the pressure behind your ear drum, such as an ear tube, is required.

with health anxiety it's often helpful to discuss your concerns with a professional. consider talking not just to your gp but also maybe a counsellor or therapist, who can help you manage your anxiety.

healthcare recommendations can vary based on your individual needs and risk factors, but for now, it's advisable to live a healthy lifestyle: eat a balanced diet, engage in regular physical activity, avoid smoking, limit alcohol consumption, and maintain a healthy weight.

2. posted age guidelines for health checkups are largely because common health conditions like heart problems, certain cancers, and diabetes become more common as people age.

3. it's essential to know that a blanket health screening isn't necessarily beneficial for everyone. over-screening can lead to unneeded tests, anxiety, and potential harm from unnecessary procedures. instead, preventative health strategies should be tailored to you as an individual, your lifestyle, and your personal and family history.

4. mental health is equally important."

I‰Ûªm having my 3rd flare of this issue. In July, I got super bad tinnitus, I couldn‰Ûªt hear anything other than a deep rumbling in my ears. I got a head CT which didn‰Ûªt show anything and it went away after 2 weeks on it‰Ûªs own. In April, it happened again, accompanied with vertigo, and I ended up in the hospital for a week because I also had SVT. Now this week, I‰Ûªm having it again. It sounds like a motorcycle is idling in my ear. My doctors say it‰Ûªs just probably caused by high blood pressure but I checked and my BP is normal. Is there anything that could better explain why this keeps happening and how to prevent it?","21F, 120lbs, POTS and FMF taking metoprolol and colchicine

meniere's disease, a disorder of the inner ear that can affect hearing and balance, may cause symptoms such as vertigo, tinnitus, and periods of hearing loss. as you mentioned experiencing vertigo, this could be something to explore with a healthcare provider.

it's also worth bearing in mind that both metoprolol (often used to treat high blood pressure and chest pain) and colchicine (normally used to treat gout and familial mediterranean fever) can cause tinnitus and vertigo as side effects, so it may be a good idea to discuss your medication regimen with your doctor.

there are more serious but rarer conditions that could be causing your symptoms, such as acoustic neuroma (a benign growth on the nerve that connects the ear to the brain), but given your other symptoms this is less likely. 

your case sounds complex and i'd strongly recommend seeing an otolaryngologist (an ear, nose, and throat specialist) who can perform a thorough investigation including detailed","first off, i'm sorry to hear about your recurrent episodes. vestibular symptoms such as tinnitus and vertigo combined might indicate conditions such as meniere's disease or vestibular neuritis. meniere's disease is a chronic condition characterized by recurrent vertigo, tinnitus, and potentially hearing loss. these symptoms are often related to a problem with fluid balance in the inner ear. vestibular neuritis is an inflammation of the inner ear usually caused by a viral infection, resulting in dizziness and loss of balance.

your doctor might consider referring you to an ear, nose, and throat (ent) specialist if they haven't already. this specialty is best equipped to explore further into the causes of your tinnitus and vertigo. 

in the meantime, it's important to control the triggers that can worsen this condition such as stress, sleep deprivation, and excessive intake of caffeine or alcohol.

keep in mind, this advice is intended to be general in nature, you should continue to consult with your primary care physician or specialists for more specific advice."
