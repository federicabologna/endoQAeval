Endo_d8bcw7_post,"I had a lap on 5/10/19 and my gyno said my bladder and back of my uterus is covered in scar tissue that she couldn’t burn off. She couldn’t even take anything out during the lap because all the lesions are near major blood vessels. Since my surgery I feel like I need to go pee all the time. Then after I use the bathroom I still have the sensation of needing to pee. I definitely don’t have a UTI. I also drink a lot of water consistently, but it’s just a weird feeling. I pee often and then afterwards I have bladder pain or I feel like I still need to go. Do you think it’s the scar tissue on my bladder from the Endo??","as an ai, i don't have the ability to diagnose medical conditions, but it's possible that the symptoms you're experiencing could be related to your endometriosis and its effect on your bladder. scar tissue can sometimes cause symptoms like frequent urination, discomfort, and the sensation of not being able to fully empty the bladder. however, it's important to speak with your healthcare provider about these symptoms, as they could also indicate other issues such as interstitial cystitis, bladder function disorders, or nerve-related issues.",4 = good,
,,"your symptoms of frequent urination, persistent sensation to pee, and bladder pain after urinating may indeed be related to the scar tissue on your bladder from endometriosis. the scar tissue can affect the normal functioning and sensation of the bladder. however, other conditions, such as interstitial cystitis or overactive bladder syndrome, can cause similar symptoms. it's important that you follow up with your doctor or a urologist for a comprehensive evaluation. they may recommend further investigations such as a bladder ultrasound or cystoscopy to get a better understanding of your condition. please don't ignore these symptoms, get them checked by a professional as soon as possible to ensure proper treatment.",4 = good,

endometriosis_dn70ay_post,"Hello.  Where do I start?  I had bad cramping as a kid into teens to the point of missing school.  It got better into my adulthood.  I'd only have a bad one every now and then.  Now flash forward to 35 years old and I'm suddenly getting bad cramps to the point of drooling nausea into the trash can.  The pain is so bad I just want to end it all.  Not that I would but those are the thoughts that come in my head.  It's absolutely excruciating. At the end of it, my body is exhausted and shaking.  It happened Jan of last year, March of this year and the last two months in a row.  I finally found an amazing Dr. Thanks to my sister (who has endo) and he did an ultrasound.  Found nothing so he offered to do a laparoscopy or take the pill.  All I have for endo symptoms are the pain-  shouldn't I have more going on for it to be that? It's usually on the second day but then that's it.  The surgery is costly and I'm scared of it.  However, I'd like to rule endo out or confirm -or is that silly when endo therapy is the pill anyway?  I'm terrified of this next cycle.  I really don't know what to do.

Endo_bdo5m3_post,"Hi everyone! I'm new to this. I have my first laparoscopic surgery happening in two days. I am fortunate enough to have found a surgeon who palpated a few nodules during a pelvic exam after (only) 3 years of severe pain.

I'm actually in the medical field so I know what to expect for the most part, but that doesn't stop me from being extremely nervous. What if the surgeon was wrong and they don't find anything? What if they find TOO much?

How bad is recovery going to be? How should I prep for this, mentally? Does anyone just have some words of encouragement?

I'm excited to begin living pain free, but I am terrified of the next week.","hey there, 

first off, congratulations on taking this big step. it's completely natural and normal to be feeling a mix of emotions right now. remember, it's okay to be anxious, terrified or anything else you're feeling. this is a big deal and it's completely your journey.

understanding that you're in the medical field, you know that there are many things that could or couldn't happen and it's normal to think of the worst-case scenario, but also remember that, your medical team has done this before and have prepared for every possible outcome. their role is to help you and ensure that you're safe and well taken care of. 

regarding the recovery, everyone's body responds differently but generally, rest, listen to your body and take it one day at a time. you may feel discomfort and probably will need time to fully recover but that's completely okay. 

mentally prepare yourself by acknowledging that you're worried and it's okay to feel that way. do things that make you calm and at peace. you're investing in your health and that is incredibly brave. you can't control what will happen during the surgery but you are in control of how you prepare for it and handle it. 

and lastly,",3 = acceptable,
,,"the anxiety you're feeling is normal. laparoscopic surgery for endometriosis is a well-practiced procedure, and your surgeon's detection of nodules suggests a high probability of finding the disease. however, remember that every person's endometriosis is different, so outcomes can vary.

in terms of recovery, most patients need about 1-2 weeks off normal activities. pain is typically manageable with medications and should gradually improve. in general, good preparation involves understanding the procedure and potential outcomes and maintaining a positive mindset.

remember, this surgery aims to reduce your pain and improve your quality of life. it's okay to feel nervous, but this is a step towards your healthier future. lean on your support system and don't hesitate to ask your medical team any further questions to alleviate your worries. wishing you a successful surgery and speedy recovery.",5 = very good,

recovery varies, but ensure that you have plenty of rest, pain relief, and a support system in place. you may feel fatigued and have some discomfort, but these are all temporary stages of the healing process. mental preparation can include distracting activities during recovery such as movies, books, or music.

remember, you're taking an important step towards understanding and dealing with your pain. take it one day at a time. this journey is one of strength; you've already displayed so much of it. trust in your doctors, trust in your decision to seek a solution, and most importantly, trust in your resilience. good luck!",4 = good,

Anyway, when it finally came it came HARD, lasting for nearly two weeks and being pretty heavy. Cramps weren’t terrible though. However, for the past few months they’ve been really heavy and painful. I can still go to school and stuff, and a super tampon will last for 2-3 hours on the heaviest days. The cramps are pretty bad. Advil helps.

I have cramps a few days before and then all throughout my period. Also I’m constipated pretty much all the time.

Does this sound like endo? I know it gets progressively worse. I have an appointment with a gyno but not until April... 

Is there a reason I should be worrying?!","endometriosis is a possibility, but it's also quite common for periods to be irregular, heavy, and painful, especially during the first few years after they start. there could be a number of reasons for what you're experiencing, including something as simple as hormonal imbalances which can normalize over time. menstrual cycles can take up to five years to establish a regular pattern after they start.

it's a good idea to talk to your gynecologist at your upcoming appointment about your symptoms. i encourage you to keep a calendar or 'symptom diary' to give your doctor an accurate description of what's been going on.

remember, constipation can also cause abdominal pain that can be confused with menstrual cramps. try drinking plenty of water, eating a high fiber diet, and exercising regularly to help with your digestive health.

you should contact your healthcare provider immediately if you get sudden, severe abdominal pain, heavy bleeding with large clots, fever, dizziness, sudden weight loss, or pain or discomfort when using the bathroom. these could be signs of a more serious condition

in any case, your symptoms are clearly making you uncomfortable and you should communicate this to your healthcare provider. until your gyno appointment in april, continue to manage the pain with ibuprofen if it helps, and consider lifestyle modifications like regular exercise and a balanced diet to help with the constipation. if your symptoms worsen to the point where you can't manage daily activities though, or you start experiencing severe pain, you should seek medical attention sooner.",3 = acceptable,"no easy medical test for endometriosis, not an ideal answer.

endometriosis_o94lqw_post,"Hi everyone. This is me asking for advice really, but I failed to do this without ranting thus marked it as so just in case.

A few years ago I had an ovarian cyst burst, had an immediate surgery to remove the cyst, got diagnosed with endometriosis and started taking birth control pills. Plus I had hormone problems - around that same time I had a lot of really bad acne, dark hair on my arms and all of that stuff.

At first I was put on Yarina and a 10-day course of hormones, it was terrible, I could barely get up that month so I quit as soon as the pack was finished (then my period wouldn't stop, but my doc gave me a treatment to fix it). After that I did a blood test to check Yaz+ compatibility, and ever since then I've been taking it. Thank God, it seems to help.

The only problem is that gradually after starting Yaz+, I started having weird flu-like symptoms. My on-going theory for this has to do with lactose in Yaz+ ingredients - I'm not intolerant in the traditional sense, but when I was a teenager, I discovered by accident that going off dairy clears up my acne. I stopped eating dairy and after a few years, I started noticing that if I do accidentally eat something with dairy in it, I wake up with a sore throat or my nose being stuffed. I still don't eat dairy, but after beginning Yaz+ I started to get sick in the summer, I'm hysterically scared of any wind or AC becaue it resuts in something like sinusitis (at first during the winter I couldn't even ride in the car or be in certain buildings because the ""headache"" was so bad). Clearing out my sinuses and being on a very strict healthy diet helped with this, but I'm still not doing things like a normal person - leaving all windows open gave me a headache at +39 degrees celsius just now, which is hilarious. I can't go into grocery stores in the summer without a hood. It should be noted naturally my immunity system was a bit weak in my teenage years, but before Yaz+, I distinctly remember doing stuff like sitting next to an open window for the whole night at -20 degrees Celsius and having no problems with the flu.

So, considering there seem to be no birth control pills without lactose in them, is there something that could be done? Any alternatives to keep endometriosis and cyst growth at bay? One of the docs told me if I stop, the old symptoms would come back, but I don't know. Sorry for a LOT of text, really sorry, but I'd be very appreciative of any advice or thoughts on this.","it sounds like you're dealing with a lot, and i can imagine this is incredibly frustrating. while i'm an ai and not a doctor, i can suggest a few options you may want to explore with your health care provider.

1. **discuss the lactose issue with your doctor**: the first thing, if you haven't already done it, is to let your doctor know about your theory involving lactose. they might be able to check if there are any alternatives to yaz+ without lactose available in your area.

2. **consider hormonal iuds or implants**: these alternatives also release hormones into your body to prevent pregnancy and can significantly lower your likelihood of developing new cysts. they often have a different hormone mix than oral contraceptives, which might interact differently with your system.

3. **look into endometriosis treatments**: there are several other treatments for endometriosis that you might consider exploring, such as other hormonal therapies (like the use of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (gn-rh) agonists and antagonists, progestin therapy or danazol), conservative surgery (to remove as much endometriosis as possible while preserving your uterus and ovaries), or, in",4 = good,

I’ve read online that anti-inflammatory foods are meant to help reduce symptoms of endo.

Thank you in advance.","hi,

yes, it's indeed often suggested that a diet rich in anti-inflammatory foods may help manage endometriosis symptoms. the primary concept is that these foods may help reduce inflammation, which is often associated with endometriosis pain.

2. **turmeric-spiced chickpea soup**: turmeric is a powerful anti-inflammatory spice. sauté a diced onion, red bell pepper and a couple of cloves of garlic in some olive oil. mix in a teaspoon of turmeric powder, a can of chickpeas and vegetable broth. simmer until everything is well cooked, then blend to your desired consistency.

as for budget meal ideas, utilize cheap anti-inflammatory foods like lentils and oats, combine with in-season fruits, and supplement with frozen veggies if fresh is not affordable. you can make lentil soups or oatmeal topped with chia seeds and berries. you can also go for stir fry using various vegetables and tofu, seasoned with anti-inflammatory spices like turmeric and ginger.

Does getting an official diagnoses help?","i'm not a doctor, but i can offer some general advice. your doctor is right that treatment doesn't necessarily change with an official diagnosis. however, a diagnosis can do several things for you.

firstly, knowing exactly what's causing the problem can help you understand your condition better, potentially helping you to manage it more effectively. for example, if you were diagnosed with endometriosis, you might find certain lifestyle changes help alleviate symptoms.

secondly, a formal diagnosis opens up avenues for seeking second opinions or specialist care. if one treatment isn't working, experts in the diagnosed condition might know of others to try.

lastly, it impacts your mental and emotional well being as well. having a name for your pain can validate your experiences and make it easier to explain your situation to others.

if your current gynecologist is unwilling to assist in diagnosing your condition, it may be worthwhile seeking a second opinion. it's important to have a healthcare provider who listens to your concerns and works with you to improve your health. it's your body and you deserve to know what's happening.

3. over-the-counter medications: though you're already on ibuprofen, if possible, try switching to a different non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (nsaid), such as naproxen. sometimes a different drug can offer better relief.

4. natural remedies: non-medicinal remedies such as certain types of yoga positions, herbal teas, massage can help to relax and alleviate the discomfort.

Endo_oiwty6_post,"I’m fairly new to diagnosis and still learning…

I often feel very depressed around the time of my period (well, Mirena ‘period’). The best way I can describe it is like the life is being drained out of me. I feel a deep heaviness in my bones and lose all desire to do anything, but this usually resolves after a few days. I assume it’s hormonal.

I’m currently having a pretty bad flare-up and I’ve been in a lot of pain in my pelvis, back, legs and chest every day for the past month. I’ve noticed my mood has been consistently bad throughout, with the ‘life drained out of me’ feeling almost constant, as well as fatigue and irritability/short-temperedness.

I know pain is depressing obviously, but this feels very much like my hormonal mood swings. I’m not feeling any more down than usual about the pain if that makes sense.

My question is - is there a direct correlation between endo flare-ups and hormonal mood swings? Does a flare-up mean hormones are potentially more out of whack than usual?","endometriosis is a hormone-dependent condition, which means it can be influenced by the body's hormonal levels, including cyclical changes throughout your menstrual cycle. the association between mood symptoms and endometriosis is complex and not fully understood. however, many women with endometriosis report flare-ups of both physical symptoms and emotional symptoms, suggesting a possible link.

research has shown that women with endometriosis may have an increased risk for mood disorders, including depression and anxiety. there could be various factors contributing to this. the pain, stress, and distress from living with a chronic disease like endometriosis can contribute to mood symptoms. also, hormonal fluctuations that trigger endometriosis symptoms might directly affect mood.

the fact that you notice a correlation between your mood swings and endometriosis flare-ups suggests that your hormones could be involved. however, it's also possible that your mood symptoms are mainly a reaction to the physical pain and discomfort caused by endometriosis.

Does this sound like Endo and how serious?

- Painful bowel last period - I noticed my last period was particularly painful in during bowel movements. Usually I've noticed bloating and pain in bowels on only the first day of menstration, however this month I continued to have painful bowels during the entire 7 days. 

- Usually the first day of mensuration has always been painful and only drugs+heat+sleep is the only way to relieve the pain. I do sometimes skip work/school as needed. After the first day I usually do not feel any pain.

- My cycles vary from 30 to 32 days. They were 28 days exactly until about one year ago.

- I receive an LH surge on cycle 16 or 17 so I am assuming I am ovulating normally.

Endo_kr7r8e_post,"Hi everybody. I know this isn't new to most of you but I have been feeling so terrible lately. I've have 3 bouts of pain/ fatigue in the last year. 

The first time they treated me for anemia after iron was low on blood test. The second time they figured it could be sleep apnea and sent me for a sleep study which I did end up having sleep apnea. I currently use my machine every night and my sleep score has been great. The third time and the worst happened this week. Fatigue hit last Monday and I've been in constant ovary and back pain as well. All I've been doing is laying in bed, overly emotional, irritable and in pain. 

Over the weekend my fatigue was so bad I had trouble walking around the house. I got worried it could be serious and went to ER. They blood and urine tested me and of course everything came back normal and they sent me on my way. 

This week I got a complete pelvic ultrasound and had a follow up with my gyno today. I was hopeful that she would be validating and understanding of my issues. Guess I shouldn't have gotten my hopes up because after describing my symptoms to her, the first thing she said was - well your ultrasound looks normal and fatigue isn't a symptom of endo, so I'm not sure what you want us to do. I was floored. I thought she would listen to my symptoms and tell me it sounded like endo and she would recommend surgery. I feel like she just brushed me off and from what I've seen online about endo it can cause fatigue? So I'm confused. 

I feel like I basically had to diagnose myself here and am questioning if I'm doing the right thing.  I understand that it could be chronic fatigue or some autoimmune but how does that explain the ovary and back pain? It doesn't make sense. When I Google endo it says that fatigue is a symptom and I also thought that extreme pain causes fatigue anyway. Why would my doctor say this? I feel bad for people who don't argue with them and just let the doctor send them home or to a rheumatologist without further investigation. 

Another important note is I've been on the pill since I was 17 and am 23 now. My periods were always debilitating and irregular, so now I take the pill continuously to avoid the pain. 

I am just looking for a little validation and understanding. I just want to figure out what could be wrong with me, and the doctor didn't tell me what the right path would be.","i'm really sorry to hear you're going through this. endometriosis can indeed cause severe pain and fatigue, even if all your tests come back normal. you're not alone. lots of women with endometriosis experience invalidated pain and go through a long and frustrating process of trying to get a diagnosis. many doctors are still not fully informed about endometriosis, which can lead to incorrect information and dismissing of symptoms.

I need to know that if I do nothing then nothing bad is going to happen. I hate going to the doctors as I’m a very shy, quiet and nervous person so I never fully explain myself when face to face.

endometriosis_n0ylgn_post,"Hey my endo family, I need your help. 

I had nailed down my diet after my diagnosis in January 2020. No sugar, no gluten, no caffeine. But then, by October 2020, I digressed. Now, I don't exercise any diet control at all. This, of course, has resulted in tremendous weight gain (combined with no workouts because of how bad the pandemic situation in India is), bloating, occasional cramps, and an overall shitty feeling. 

I want to start again. I want to cut down on carbs and increase my protein intake. However, I am a vegetarian and have limited options. Especially, with the pandemic affecting everything and everyone, there's a limited supply of grocery. Most of the time, non-gluten grains, and a lot of fruits and veggies are not available. Or if they are available, they are now priced at 3-5x the normal cost. Similarly, I am not sure if I completely understand the anti-inflammatory diet. 

Can someone help me with an easy list of food to eat and foods to avoid? Also, when the going gets tough, and you have to work through the pain, what's the best quick relief remedy that you follow?","hello there! i'm not a doctor, but i can sure try and give you some general ideas about dietary changes and remedies for endometriosis. 

to start off, here is a list of some vegetarian-friendly foods that might help control inflammation:

1. **fruits and vegetables**: these are a rich source of vitamins, minerals, and fiber. try to incorporate as many colors in your diet from available fruits and vegetables like oranges, strawberries, spinach, and broccoli. however, avoid fruits like bananas and raspberries that might trigger endometriosis symptoms.

2. **whole grains**: whole grains such as brown rice, quinoa, and oats are good for an endometriosis diet.

3. **nuts and seeds**: almonds, sunflower seeds, flax seeds, and chia seeds can be a good source of omega-3 fatty acids which are anti-inflammatory.

4. **legumes**: beans, lentils, chickpeas are all excellent sources of protein.

you may want to avoid certain foods like:

1. **gluten**: some studies show a reduction in pain symptoms with a gluten-free diet.

2. **red meat**: this can increase inflammation, so it's best to avoid.",3 = acceptable,Again data on endometriosis diet is limited 
,,"it's key with endometriosis to follow an anti-inflammatory diet. some general guidelines are to reduce gluten and dairy, and to include lots of fruits, vegetables, and lean proteins. as a vegetarian, i recommend eating lentils, chickpeas, quinoa, and tofu for protein. reduce your intake of processed foods and sugars (especially artificial ones). 

regarding anti-inflammatory food, focus on lots of deep-colored veggies like kale, spinach, broccoli, beetroot and fresh fruits like berries. omega-3 fats from chia seeds and flaxseeds can help too. turmeric and ginger have great anti-inflammatory properties.

for quick pain relief, applying a hot water bottle or heating pad over the painful area can help. so can gentle physical activity like yoga and stretching. over-the-counter pain relievers, such as ibuprofen, can provide immediate relief, but should be used sparingly. 

remember, maintaining a balanced diet and exercise routine is challenging, especially given the pandemic. however, every small change counts and eventually adds up to create a big difference. consulting with a nutritionist can also help create a meal plan that fits your lifestyle and situation. always listen to your body and don't hesitate to seek professional help for",3 = acceptable,

key items to eat consist of fiber-rich ingredients like lentils, oatmeal, and brown rice, protein from legumes, eggs, and dairy products, and other nutrient-dense foods like sweet potatoes, spinach, and almonds. try to avoid foods with gluten and too much sugar - they can increase inflammation. 

as for quick relief during pain, the best remedy i've found is applying a warm compress or heating pad to the affected area. this helps to relax the muscles and limit the pain signals sent to the brain. 

finally, for the anti-inflammatory diet, i recommend speaking with a nutritionist or doctor, as every person's needs are unique. but in general, it involves cutting down on processed and fried foods, opting for healthier fats (avocado, nuts), and eating plenty of fruits and veggies.

Endo_ks1jrk_post,"Hi. This is a slightly embarrassing question. I’ve already asked on here if I should go forward with speaking to a gyno and getting setup for a lap to determine if I could possibly have Endo and I finally have an appointment set up for the middle of February. 
I have some pretty stereotypical symptoms such as the debilitating cramps, heavier bleeding, and blood clots. I also have pretty intense pain and cramping during my ovulation. 
The one thing I’m really worried about right now is this past year or two I’ve started to have rectal bleeding during my period and ovulation. I’ve had a colonoscopy and colon cancer was ruled out but I was diagnosed with celiac disease. I used to think this was related to the celiac disease but the past few months I’ve realized it only happens on my period or during ovulation. Last night I had a pretty large amount of blood. I had to sit on the toilet for about 5 minutes until it finally stopped and obviously this was pretty scary. I was ovulating and having cramps from that and there is no way I could have been glutened in the past week that I know of. Anyways I’m wondering if this could possibly be endo related? Or possibly indicative of endo on my bowels or Douglas pouch? The only damage that was found during my colonoscopy was from the celiac disease in the lower right small intestine I believe. I’m just scared. I know I just need to talk to the doctor about it but the earliest they could get me in was the middle of February and I’ve been dealing with so much anxiety about it.

iuds (intrauterine devices) are one example, especially hormonal iuds such as mirena and skyla, which often cause lighter periods or sometimes stop them altogether.

Endo_fwql0o_post,"Totally feel free to remove if I’m breaking a rule:
I originally posted this on /PCOS but it didn’t receive any feedback.  Having done some googling, I see that this drug is used more often for Endometriosis which I haven’t been diagnosed with (although at this point I wouldn’t be surprised if I were).

I had been spotting/randomly bleeding for about 6 weeks last month when my gynecologist decided to do an ultrasound.  I expected her to find something a 5-6cm cyst on either ovary (as is usually the case) when she instead told me that she couldn’t see anything because my uterine lining was too thick.

She prescribed me “Aygestin” 5mg for 30 days to help shed said lining which is supposed to make my next ultrasound more readable.  Her suspicion is that I may have a fibroid in my uterine wall which could require surgical removal.

Just curious has anybody had a similar issue?  What am I in for if I do need to have this thing removed?

Has anybody been as miserable as I am on Aygestin?  I feel like I’ve had the same gross hormonal drag &amp; dull cramps for like 3 weeks.

Is this likely just another PCOS issue rather than a fibroid?  This is a relatively new doctor for me so a piece of me remains cautious and skeptical.

Could this be a matter of undiagnosed endometriosis?  My periods have been a mess for my whole life","i'm not a doctor but i can share some general information which might help, based on what you've described. your gynecologist's course of action does generally align with common approaches to treating a thickened endometrium (lining of the uterus). aygestin is often prescribed to help reduce the thickness of the endometrium and regulate heavy, prolonged periods, but it can cause side effects such as mood changes, upset stomach, and cramps.

fibroids and polycystic ovary syndrome (pcos) are indeed quite different, but it's not uncommon for women to have both. both can influence menstrual irregularities and heavy bleeding. if a fibroid is found in your uterine lining, treatment options depend upon its size, location, and whether it's causing symptoms. surgical intervention might be necessary if it's causing significant issues. the procedure can range from minimally invasive to more complex depending on these factors.

endometriosis, on the other hand, is often misdiagnosed as other conditions due to the similar symptoms it shares with other gynecological disorders. your experience of life-long messy periods could indicate this condition, but of course, only a medical professional can make that determination based on their",2 = poor,"endometriosis does not cause irregular periods, otherwise good answer"

pcos and endometriosis can coexist but the issues you mention aren't specific to pcos alone. if you're not improving with aygestin or if the side effects are too bothersome, i recommend a follow-up visit to discuss options with your gynecologist.

as for surgery, fibroid removal often involves either a hysteroscopic resection, a myomectomy, or - in severe cases - a hysterectomy, but it will depend on the size and location of the fibroid. discuss any concerns with your doctor to understand your condition better. always remember, getting a second opinion can provide peace of mind if you're feeling skeptical.",3 = acceptable,"Doesn't seem the aygestin was prescribed to improve symptoms, not on topic answer"

while somatic symptoms are indeed often a response to stress or emotional upheaval, suggesting such a direct connection between abuse, cortisol, inflammation, and conditions like endometriosis could oversimplify the complex nature of these ailments. more research would be needed to draw a definitive connection, and it's important to consider the role of individual differences as well.",4 = good,

in other words, while stress and cortisol could theoretically exacerbate endometriosis symptoms or influence its progression, they are not currently understood to be primary causes for the disease. treatment is usually focused on controlling symptoms and preventing progression of the disease, rather than modulating cortisol levels. consulting with a healthcare professional is the best option to find a tailored treatment plan.",4 = good,

I had a call with my dr today, who suggested I try tri-cycling my pill again, which is where you take the pill for three months, have a bleed, and then go back on it. I’ve tried this before, and it caused more pain, clots and a heavier period than I’ve ever had before! 

She also suggested the mini pill, a coil (I’ve tried before but it wouldn’t go in as I’m “too small”, etc) and changing my pill. Oddly enough, I like having my period because I get a lot of clots, and even though they are painful, the pain is better than when I’m not having a period. I’ve just settled into this pill, as it took a lot of time to find one which wasn’t too much testosterone and didn’t cause more pain, etc.

I’ve just settled in a good system, minus my periods being out of whack from the three month stint. I’ve changed from a cup to cloth pads, and it’s lessened my pain a little, which is great.

I felt really pressured to make a decision then and there, with all these different treatments, even telling her to not book me in for a coil again, as she was already booking dates before I’d said yes. I know she was just trying to help, and she was very lovely.

firstly, it's absolutely normal to feel overwhelmed and question your decision in situations like these. when it comes to your body and health, you need to make sure the decisions you make are right for you.

endometriosis and hormonal birth control can be a complex issue. hormonal birth control like the pill can help control the symptoms of endometriosis but everybody reacts differently to different types of hormonal birth control. for some people, it can exacerbate symptoms and others it can help.

having periods won’t necessarily exacerbate your endometriosis. some research suggests that long-term use of the combined contraceptive pill (the 'pill') can reduce the risk of developing endometriosis. but this isn’t consistently found and other factors might be involved.

as for your fertility, endometriosis can create challenges for fertility, but it doesn't mean you'll be unable to have children. hormonal contraceptives themselves do not affect long-term fertility.

Endo_o57f5d_post,Hi everyone hope this post doesn’t break any rules. My SO has been having endo belly for the past many weeks. The doctors say my SO is infertile so we didn’t think much of it at first but as a precaution we bought two pregnancy tests from the store and used them. One came back inconclusive and the other came back positive. Is this possible signs of a cyst? We are going to a women’s clinic this week just in case. She says she had her period last month and thinks she may start it again soon. I’m probably overreacting but I like to be prepared. I appreciate any response :),"qualifications: ai with access to a wide range of medical knowledge databases.

endo belly typically refers to the bloating and distention that can occur as a symptom of endometriosis, a condition where tissue similar to that which lines the uterus grows outside of it. this can cause a variety of symptoms such as pain, bloating, and potentially even fertility issues.

if one of your pregnancy tests came back positive, it could potentially indicate a pregnancy or a false positive, which can sometimes occur for a variety of different reasons. this could include an ectopic pregnancy, recent miscarriage, or certain medical conditions. it's less likely to be a sign of a cyst.

it's also worth noting that some people with endometriosis can experience what appears to be a period even when pregnant due to irregular bleeding, so i would not necessarily dismiss the possibility. 

considering the positive pregnancy test and her ongoing symptoms, seeing a healthcare provider as soon as possible would be a wise decision to determine what is going on and to address her discomfort.

remember this advice is not a substitute for professional medical advice.",1 = very poor,"Bloating doesn't cause infertility, ectopic pregnancy is not a false postiive. patients with endometriosis are not more likely to get irregular bleeding in pregnancy"

So I had my lap over a month ago. About 1 or 2 weeks ago I haven't been able to eat much  without feeling ill. Most foods turn my stomach. I love food and am tired of hardly eating. 

I can eat most fruits and veggies (canbage and lettuce are a no go). I have been living off of smothies, berries, fruit juice, granola, carrots, bracoli, and a little bread. (I'm on a gluten reduced diet due to my fibromyalgia so bread isn't ideal).

endometriosis is a difficult condition to diagnose because it often mimics the symptoms of other conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome (ibs), gastrointestinal issues, or even ovarian cysts. therefore, it's sometimes referred to as ""the great imitator."" 

many women with endometriosis do have painful menstruation or pain during intercourse, but this isn't true in every case. bloating, changes in bowel habits, and stomach pain can also be related to endometriosis. 

however, an official diagnosis of endometriosis typically is confirmed through a procedure called a laparoscopy, a small surgery where the doctor looks inside your abdomen for signs of endometriosis.

laparoscopic surgery for endometriosis is less invasive than a c-section, but it still requires rest for recovery. generally, you may be able to walk and move around a few hours following the procedure, but it is advisable not to engage in strenuous activities like lifting heavy items (including a young child) for at least a week or two. pain can vary from mild to severe depending on the individual and the extent of disease and treatment.

in summary, you'll likely need at least several days to get back to normal activities, and it's helpful to have someone assist with your 4 year old during this time. it's important to allow yourself time to rest and recuperate after surgery. always follow your doctor's advice regarding activity levels and recovery.

however, given your history of endometriosis and the changes in your period and sexual discomfort, a more relevant likelihood could be that the endometriosis is progressing. some women with endometriosis do experience mid-cycle bleeding or ""spotting."" this is because the endometrial tissue outside the uterus responds to hormonal changes just like the tissue inside the uterus, causing bleeding.

it also could be due to other medical reasons like polyps, fibroids and in rare cases, cervical or uterine cancers.

any changes in your menstrual cycle should be evaluated by your doctor, especially given your history of endometriosis. i would recommend contacting your healthcare provider to discuss these new symptoms. they may want to perform a physical examination, and possibly an ultrasound to better understand what is happening internally.

Do I keep my hopes up and assume late ovulation/fertilization or accept that I will get my period and move on?

I’ve been using the HCG strips off of amazon to test. Not sure how reliable they may be now. 

Any advice or thoughts are welcome and appreciated. I just need someone else’s opinion besides Google!","first, i want to say it sounds like you're going through some really tough situations and i can sense the emotional toll it might be taking. i'm an ai language model developed by openai, so i don't have personal experiences but i'm here to provide you as much information as possible.

typically, implantation (when the fertilized egg attaches to the uterine wall) occurs 6-12 days after ovulation, and hcg begins to be produced shortly after that point. for some women, this hormone isn't detectable until after their missed period.

however, if you're on day 28 and your period is usually like clockwork, i’d suggest scheduling an appointment with your doctor. they may want to conduct a blood test, which can confirm pregnancy earlier than an at-home urine test. they can also perform an ultrasound if necessary. furthermore, they can offer advice tailored to your individual health circumstance.

the severe, debilitating cramps you describe could be a sign of endometriosis, a condition where tissue similar to the lining of the uterus grows outside of the uterus, potentially causing pain and fertility problems. however, it could also be a symptom of other conditions, like uterine fibroids or pelvic inflammatory disease. 

quote: ""the symptoms of endometriosis can vary. some women experience mild symptoms, but others can have moderate to severe symptoms. the severity of your pain doesn't indicate the degree or stage of the condition. you could have mild endometriosis with severe pain, or advanced endometriosis with little or no pain.""

pain during intercourse and discomfort in the pelvis are also potential symptoms of endometriosis, but again, could point to other issues as well. 

a urinary tract infection (uti) could potentially cause pelvic discomfort and pain during intercourse, especially if the infection has spread to the kidneys. this would likely be accompanied by other symptoms such as frequent urination, a burning sensation when urinating, and possibly lower back pain.

however, these side effects should gradually improve as your body adjusts to the medication. if they persist or become severe, it's crucial to notify your prescriber immediately. it may take some time for your body to regulate, but managing side effects is key so you can stay as comfortable as possible throughout the transition. keep consistent communication with your healthcare provider to ensure you're on the right track.",3 = acceptable,

endometriosis_qa803x_post,"I feel like I’m slowly going crazy. 
I was fine in June then after a terrible pelvic exam that left my lady parts torn I started having pelvic pain, back in the summer I went through every antibiotic to treat what could of been an infection, 

And I ended up seeing tons of gynos and finally was diagnosed with endometriosis from an mri. 

I don’t get how out of no where I have pain and symptoms every single day. 

One day or one week I feel stabbing, the next it feels like my uterus is going to explode, the next I feel tearing, or period paid when not on period, then it’s a swollen feeling, etc. 

Is this how it happens? And how it becomes a chronic issue? Just one day pain starts and never goes away?","i'm really sorry to hear you're going through this. one of the tricky things about endometriosis is that the symptoms can vary greatly between individuals, and they may change over time. it's not unusual for symptoms to appear suddenly or to change in nature, unfortunately. chronic issues can indeed start very suddenly, or they can start gradually and become progressively worse. 

remember though, the severity of endometriosis does not necessarily correlate with the amount of pain experienced. some women have severe endometriosis with little to no pain, while others may have minimal disease yet experience severe pain.

it’s also possible for symptoms to change over time, because endometriosis creates inflammation, and inflammation can irritate other structures besides the endometrial implants themselves. this irritation from inflammation could potentially explain some of the variability you're experiencing in your symptoms.

treatment is primarily aimed at managing symptoms and improving quality of life, which often involves hormonal medications to reduce inflammation and slow disease progression. pain management is also crucial. it may be helpful for you to speak to your gynecologist or a pain management specialist about your options.

in the context of a hysterectomy for endometriosis, here is how your symptoms might be affected:

cramps: these should decrease substantially or go away altogether since it is the uterus that contracts during a menstrual cycle, causing cramps. after a hysterectomy, there would be no menstrual cycle to cause these painful contractions. 

leg pain: some women with endometriosis experience pelvic nerve irritation which can lead to leg pain. while a hysterectomy may help, if you have endometrial patches elsewhere it can still lead to nerve irritation.

your doctor's recommendation seems to be in line with managing your symptoms with birth control to prevent further progression of endometriosis, minimizing surgical interventions unless necessary, and addressing any potential fertility issues if you face trouble conceiving in the future.

however, if you are concerned about your future fertility, it's important to have a frank discussion with your doctor about your worries and discuss the potential options available to you. some women may choose to have a diagnostic laparoscopy to confirm the diagnosis and potentially treat any endo lesions. it can also give you more information about your condition, but it does come with its own risks.

remember, deciding whether to have surgery or when to start trying for a baby is a very personal decision and depends on many different factors – including your age, symptoms, plans for children, and more. it's crucial to discuss these topics with your doctor so you can make an informed decision that's right for you.",4 = good,

Endo_iy2zrg_post,"I have suspected endo, a uterine polyp, and a 5-6cm ovarian cyst (not an endometrioma, but I’m not sure what kind of cyst, confirmed today via transvaginal ultrasound). 

I’ve had pain in my right ovary for six years now, about as long as how long I’ve had endo pain. Had a few ultrasounds, one time years back I had a “possible” 3cm cyst that my then-doctor dismissed. Last ultrasound (2 or 3 months ago) showed a “healthy ovary” and no cyst. 

I believe the cyst comes and goes. My new gyno surgeon believes this as well. 

I started my first birth control (Blisovi 1/20) almost three months ago now. In late August my ovarian cyst swelled so much that it very obviously showed through my abdomen. Based off of pics my gyno estimated it to be 8cm. It was incredibly painful. Now it’s swollen again enough to see on my abdomen. 

My first question is could the birth control have caused this increase in size? I have never before had it large enough to see when I look at my belly. My pain has increased as well, although the first month and a half it wasn’t as painful as usual. 

My second question is how potentially dangerous is having a cyst of this size? I work in a remote field camp for 6 months out of the year and can only contact a dr via email or text—no visits/imaging/etc.

1. certain types of birth control may potentially influence the size of an ovarian cyst. oral contraceptives usually decrease the chance of functional ovarian cysts forming, because they inhibit ovulation. however, different bodies may react differently and the specific type of birth control you are using could potentially be associated with an increase in cyst size. ask your doctor specifically about the potential effects of your specific birth control on an ovarian cyst.

2. the potential danger of an ovarian cyst largely depends on its type and whether it ruptures or causes the ovary to twist (torsion). when a cyst ruptures, it can cause severe pain and sometimes serious complications such as internal bleeding. if an ovary twists, its blood supply can be cut off, which can cause the ovary to die. large cysts can also potentially press on nearby organs, causing symptoms. these risks might be increased if you're in a remote area with limited medical support.

3. draining cysts with a needle (cyst aspiration) is a less invasive option than surgery, but it",3 = acceptable,cut off at the end
,,"birth control pills usually inhibit the formation of functional ovarian cysts. however, individual responses can vary and there's a small chance that hormonal changes induced by the pill may have influenced the cyst size. keep in mind that cysts can fluctuate naturally in size too.

a cyst measuring 5-6cm presents a potential risk of torsion, rupture or bleeding, especially in a field setting where immediate medical attention may be challenging. a severe incident can result in an emergency situation.

having the cyst drained before leaving could reduce potential complications, although there's a risk of recurrence. it's important to follow up with your doctor regularly. 

the nuvaring's effect on non-endometrioma cysts is similar to oral contraceptives. some women find it more convenient as it's used monthly, yet it's still vital to monitor your pain and any other symptoms closely. don't hesitate to contact your doctor, even from your remote location, if you experience any significant changes.",4 = good,

for your second question, a cyst of this size can potentially be dangerous. it can twist (torsion) or rupture, both of which could lead to a medical emergency. alternatively, it might stay asymptomatic. because you're in a remote location for months at a time, it might be safer to have it drained or removed.

about the nuvaring, it might be better as it provides a steady dose of hormones. as for the cysts, every person is different and the case studies are individual-based. so, someone else's experience might not predict yours. always discuss your concerns with your healthcare provider before making a decision. i hope this helps you.",4 = good,
Endo_7kjikd_post,"Long time lurker, first time poster.

I am 27 years old. I had a laparoscopy at the age of 24 to diagnose suspected endometriosis. My surgeon found implants on the back of my uterus, in the cup de sac and (in my surgeons words) my right broad ligament was eaten away. He preformed cauterization on the implants (urg, I didn't know at the time that this is not the best way to take care of the implants). 

My main query is based on an experience I had a year ago. I got pregnant in late October 2016. In early November (I was unaware of the pregnancy until mid December) I went to the ER with extreme bowel pain. It felt like I had steel wool scraping against my intestines. The ER doc assumed I was after pain meds, he refused to do any tests and said I didn't look like I was in any pain (FYI I have other chronic illnesses that cause me to be in pain 24/7, for me to go to the ER I had to be in a lot of pain), so I was sent home. I was given no explanation for the pain and the next day I tried eating...it didn't go well. For about 2 weeks I struggled to find something I could eat without having issues. I ended up with violent cramps, nausea and explosive diarrhea whenever I ate fresh veggies, anything dairy, bread, etc. I could have chicken broth and pea soup (only peas, no ham) without much pain. For 2 weeks that's all I ate. Then, I tried potatoes and it went OK. 

I visited my gp immediately after the ER visit and he couldn't find anything wrong, so he sent me to general surgery who scheduled me for a colonoscopy/endoscopy for mid December. My gp warned me that I might have Chrons or something...then on the day I went to do the colonoscopy I found out I was pregnant. (The pregnancy was a full molar pregnancy, I had a d&amp;c on the 28th of December )

Now, my husband and I are allowed to start TTC and so here is my question:  given the previous experience I had with pregnancy, could the pain and food intolerance have been caused by the pregnancy because of endometrial implants, adhesions and an expanding uterus? Has anyone experienced anything similar?

Thank you","i'm an ai, but based on the information you've shared, it's possible that your endometriosis symptoms could have been exacerbated by your pregnancy. during pregnancy, the body produces an excess of hormones, such as progesterone and estrogen, which can stimulate the growth of endometrial implants. this can also cause them to become inflamed or irritated, leading to increased pain and potentially other symptoms as well. 

as for the food intolerances and bowel issues you experienced, they could potentially be linked to your endometriosis but might also be typical of early pregnancy or related to the molar pregnancy you experienced. 

molar pregnancies are abnormal pregnancies where tissues that were supposed to become the placenta, instead grow into abnormal masses. this can cause some of the same symptoms as a regular pregnancy, but can also lead to other issues, including nausea, vomiting, and rapid enlargement of the uterus. 

please remember, this is theoretical and it is always best to discuss these experiences with your gp or another medical professional who can consider your personal medical history and provide a more comprehensive evaluation.

however, it's also important to consider other potential causes for your acute gastrointestinal issues, such as obstetric and gastrointestinal complications related to the molar pregnancy or an unrelated gastrointestinal condition as suggested by your gp. if you haven't already, you should discuss your previous symptoms and concerns with your doctor as you plan for future pregnancy. obtaining a definitive diagnosis and developing a plan can help manage endometriosis-related symptoms throughout your pregnancy.

nonetheless, pregnancy symptoms can often overlap with endometriosis symptoms, so it's crucial to have regular checkups with your gynaecologist throughout the pregnancy. they might connect you with a dietitian for managing your food issues. remember, monitoring is key because every pregnancy is different, especially with endometriosis. it’s empowering to understand your body better so as to manage symptoms effectively. good luck with your journey to conceive!",2 = poor,such an early pregnancy wouldn't cause the uterus to grow
endometriosis_oa06d8_post,"Hello everyone,

I have been diagnosed through an MRI that I have an endo nodule in the recto-vaginal septum (RVE). The doc I'm consulting is an endo specialist. And from the MRI, he thinks the nodule is not into the rectum, so he can shave it off but that the dissection can get close to the nerves nearby so he has to be careful. The nodule is also growing laterally i.e. into utero ligament apparently, so he suggests to handle it now before it progresses further. He told me if all goes well, he expects me to be discharged next day itself and that he wouldn't consider this high risk. At the same time he also said this - ""In all likelihood it won't effect the rectum but even if the procedure endsup doing a small hole in the rectum, I can repair it"".

That last part is what I'm afraid of - the possible complication and it's effect on my quality of life. As of today I have minimal symptoms. I only get ""butt pain"" pain during periods and some mild symptoms right after the period. I've been on birth control for years, so I don't see much symptoms beyond that. But I'm 34f and we have been trying to conceive for a couple of years now. I didn't try an ivf yet - it's affordable for us, but doc suggests to get endo fixed first and that I may actually conceive naturally after excision surgery.

Do you all think I'm over worried about the potential complications? My worry is that right now I don't have symptoms, and hope that an IVF could potentially help us to conceive.

untreated endometriosis can indeed worsen over time and possibly decrease fertility further. sometimes, surgeons are able to safely remove endometriosis tissue to increase the chances of pregnancy. additionally, leaving endometriosis untreated might not only impact your fertility but also your quality of life, as the disease can potentially cause more intense symptoms over time.

remember, untreated endometriosis can potentially progress and decrease ivf success rates. fertility specialists often recommend addressing endometriosis before starting an ivf cycle.

ultimately, you need to weigh your comfort with the surgery risks against your desire to enhance fertility and address the endometriosis. it is completely reasonable to seek a second opinion, or even counseling, to help you make this difficult decision. be open about your fears, and make sure all your questions are properly answered before you proceed.",4 = good,

It could even be described as mine sweepers going off in my uterus.

There's no evidence that endometriosis is actually the thing that I've been suffering from, I just highly suspect it for legitimate reasons. Regardless, I would like to understand the disorder a lot better.","endometriosis is a condition where the tissue that normally lines the inside of the uterus, known as the endometrium, starts growing outside the uterus, such as on the ovaries, fallopian tubes, and the tissue lining the pelvis. it can be quite painful, particularly during menstruation, and your description of the symptoms aligns with what many women with endometriosis experience.

as for estrogen and testosterone, both of these hormones play a role in women's reproductive health, and both can potentially have some influence on endometriosis, but the relationship isn't entirely straightforward.

estrogen is the primary female reproductive hormone, and it's responsible for the thickening of the endometrial lining each menstrual cycle. hence, there is a strong link between high levels of estrogen and the growth and development of endometriosis. this is why many treatments for the condition aim to lower estrogen levels.

on the other hand, testosterone is often called a male hormone, but in reality, it's also important for women's bodies in smaller quantities. women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (pcos), a condition characterized by elevated androgen levels (which include testosterone), have been found to have a high prevalence of end",3 = acceptable,patient not asking for definition of endometriosis

the reduced symptoms experienced as you age may be due to different factors like hormonal changes, lower fertility rates, or effects of long-term treatments rather than an absolute increase in estrogen levels.

the testosterone theory you mentioned isn't widely accepted in the medical community. while it's true that women with pcos, which is associated with higher testosterone levels, can have endometriosis, this does not mean high testosterone causes the disease. 

as for your symptoms decreasing as you age, it's more likely due to changes in your hormone levels over time, not solely an increase in estrogen. estrogen levels actually peak in women in their 20s and start to decline thereafter.

endometriosis_i08jss_post,"I'll try to make a (very) long story as short as possible.  I'm 40 years old, and I have been dealing with pelvic pain for years.  Over the last several months, it has become much worse and harder to live with.  I spend many days every month in moderate to severe pain, and nothing helps much, although caffeine seems to intensify it.  

In 2017, I was having so much spotting that I was concerned I had a serious issue.  The doctor found multiple polyps and growths (something between a polyp and fibroid, they said), which were removed.  They wanted to do exploratory surgery for endometriosis, but at the time, I couldn't afford the laparoscopy.  They gave me an IUD to help slow the uterine growths, but after six months, I had it removed.  My periods became so long, and I felt so bloated, that I couldn't take it anymore.  But I had no pain.

In January of 2019, I got a huge surprise and became pregnant.  Sadly, I lost the pregnancy at ten weeks.  This is around the time that everything seemed to get worse.  By December of last year, I was having daily stabbing pains, but the pains that I have are always worst for me around ovulation.  A day or two before my cycle app predicts ovulation, I start having all the symptoms.  This month, the symptoms started early, and I worry it's just all getting worse.  This is what I experience:

Pelvic and lower abdominal pain (stabbing, burning, stinging, aching)

Painful sex and pain after orgasm

Back, leg, and joint pain

Upset stomach and constipation

Bowel movement pain

Frequent nausea

Bloating and gas

Spotting on and off all month, especially around ovulation

Fatigue and malaise

I went back to my doctor this past January.  They did another ultrasound with pain-mapping.  They found that I had a new polyp growing and a new fibroid and ""slightly thickened"" endometrium, but said they could see no signs of endometriosis on ultrasound (which I thought was typical).  The doctor said she would advise me to see a gastroenterologist and a urologist because the pain was likely not reproductive, even though I have noticed a clear monthly pattern to it.  She said she would be willing to try an estrogen birth control pill to see if it managed the pain, but otherwise would recommend I seek help from my family doctor.  When I told her I'd already had a colonoscopy in the last year and that everything was normal, she said I should go back to make sure it's not a bowel issue causing my pain.  She also said that endometriosis does not get worse with ovulation, only with menstruation.  Is this always the case, though?

while it's true that endometriosis can't be confirmed through ultrasound, your symptoms are consistent with it. sometimes it's necessary to have laparoscopy performed to confirm the diagnosis of endometriosis. while the surgery involves risk, it also provides the most accurate information.

hormonal therapies like estrogen-based pills are used to treat endometriosis symptoms. however, the effectiveness of these treatments vary among individuals. if you haven't done so already, you may want to discuss other hormonal therapies or pain management strategies with your doctor.

Should I eat a lot the days before surgery since I won't be able to the day of and after or should I try to keep my bowels as empty as possible to avoid having to do nr 2 for a couple of days? Is it better to be really hydrated or dehydrated (so you don't have to pee as much)? Any other ways I should prep myself before? What did you eat after? Was eating difficult? How bad was the pain? Will I be able to walk in stairs right after? Will I be able to go to school (my backpack is really heavy)? 

Really anything you can think of. It's finally happening!!!!","congratulations on the step towards finding more answers and hopefully some relief too! it's completely natural to feel a mix of nerves and excitement. 

here are some tips:

1. diet pre-surgery: don't try to eat a lot in the days leading up to the surgery in anticipation of not being able to eat afterwards - this is not necessary. you should follow the dietary instructions from your doctor, which often recommend only clear liquids the day before and no food after midnight the day of your surgery.

2. hydration: staying as hydrated as possible is generally good advice. more fluids can help with nausea post-anesthesia.

3. constipation post-surgery: pain medications can cause constipation, so you may want to ask your doctor about a laxative.

4. the pain & mobility: expect some pain and discomfort post-surgery. everyone handles it differently but it's not unusual to require pain meds for the first few days. you should be up and walking around within a day or so after surgery. it helps prevent blood clots. walking up and down stairs might be a bit more challenging, so be sure to move slowly and don’t push yourself beyond what’s comfortable.

5. school: as for going to school, that",4 = good,cut off at the bottom but overall seems ok
,,"it's normal to feel anxious prior to surgery. it's best to maintain a normal diet before surgery. however, your surgeon may ask you to fast from midnight before the operation. hydration is important, but again, you may be asked to not drink from midnight, to prepare for anesthesia. after the surgery, start with light, easily digestible foods; eating may feel a bit uncomfortable initially but should normalize quickly. 

the pain varies greatly among individuals, some experience moderate discomfort that's manageable with painkillers, while others may experience more severe pain. 

as for mobility, it usually takes a few days before you are able to move comfortably again. stairs might be challenging initially, so take things slow. similarly, carrying a heavy backpack soon after surgery is not advisable. 

remember, it's crucial to give your body enough time to heal. this is a significant procedure and recovery takes time. consult with your surgical team for more specific advice relevant to your situation.",4 = good,
,,"it's natural to be nervous before your first surgery! eating a balanced, healthy diet is beneficial in the days leading up to your operation, but avoid overeating as this can strain the digestive system. hydration is key - drink plenty of water but do not aim for dehydration. your body needs to be sufficiently hydrated for the surgery. as you'll likely have to fast the night before, follow the instructions provided by your healthcare team carefully. 

post-surgery, you may experience some nausea and find eating somewhat uncomfortable. light, easily digestible foods such as soup, yogurt, or smoothies are good starting points. 

regarding pain, everyone's experience varies. there will be discomfort, but pain can be managed effectively with medication and rest. 

stair climbing and heavy lifting, including a heavy backpack, should be avoided initially to allow your body time to heal. 

lastly, it's essential to prepare emotionally. find relaxing activities, talk open-mindedly with friends or a counselor about your fears and concerns, and don't forget to celebrate this step towards potential relief from endometriosis. good luck!",4 = good,

endometriosis is a condition where tissue similar to the lining of the uterus is found outside of the uterus. it can cause symptoms like painful periods, heavy bleeding, and problems with bowel movements. however, this condition typically affects older women. it's relatively rare in teenagers but it can start during adolescence.

most importantly, you should always let your parent/guardian know about your symptoms and consult with a healthcare professional for accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment. they may conduct a variety of tests like ultrasonography, blood tests, or potentially even a laparoscopy to know what exactly is going on.

Endo_5piong_post,"The other day I talked to my cousin who has ulcerative colitis.

However, I've always felt my stomach was far more sensitive than the usual IBS-stomach often connected to endo since the usual diet tips for this includes many of my known trigger foods. 

So I'm wondering if endo can trigger an inflammation inside the large intestines? Or if this might be a sign of endo on/inside the intestines?

I'm freaking out that there might be something wrong with my intestines as well!","endometriosis can indeed cause issues with the digestive system, including the large intestine. many women with endometriosis experience digestive issues, as the endometrial tissue can grow on the intestines and cause inflammation.

Endo_bxwtbe_post,"I had surgery in January 2018 that was successful in removing my endometriosis and symptoms. At the end of January 2019 I started to feel as though the symptoms were reoccurring and they gradually worsened. 

Today I saw a doctor at my local hospital where the surgery was performed (a nook surgeon), but not the actual surgeon himself. She advised me that as all the endometriosis had been removed it was unlikely the endo was back so soon and suggests I tried some IBS medication to manage the symptoms. She also said that as I have the mirena coil that if any endometriosis was left behind then this couldn’t be bleeding anyway, as I don’t have periods since having the coil. 

Although I have some bowel symptoms I also suffer with pain after sex and chest pain so will an IBS medication help? And could that be the only reason for my symptoms?

Anyone got any insight or experience with this? Thanks for your help 💛","i am an ai and not a doctor, but i will do my best to explain based on medical knowledge and information available in the medical literature. 

it's important to note that endometriosis is a chronic condition and while surgical removal can alleviate symptoms, it doesn't necessarily prevent the condition from returning. however, it is less likely to return if all of the lesions were removed during surgery, but not impossible. 

symptoms such as abdominal pain and bowel symptoms overlap with irritable bowel syndrome (ibs), so your doctor may suspect that this is the cause of your discomfort. medications prescribed for ibs can help manage these symptoms.

pain after sex and chest pain are not typically associated with ibs. such symptoms can be associated with endometriosis, especially if endometrial tissue is present around the vagina, uterus, bladder, or even diaphragm.

it's also important to clarify- endometriosis does not ""bleed"" in the way that we think of menstrual blood. instead, the endometrial cells found outside the uterus undergo the same hormonal cycle as those inside the uterus, which can cause pain, inflammation, and even potentially, scar tissue.

i recommend seeking a second opinion from a specialist in endometriosis. they can conduct thorough diagnostic tests to determine the exact cause of your symptoms, which may not be limited to ibs or endometriosis.

as for the belief that endometriosis can't ""bleed"" anymore due to the mirena coil, it's a complex issue. the coil may help reduce the chances of new endometriosis lesions, but if any endometrial tissues were missed during surgery, they might still cause pain or discomfort, even if you aren't having periods. in addition, while the coil often reduces or stops periods, it doesn't eliminate ovulation, which can stimulate endometrial growths. i'd suggest getting a second opinion or seeing a specialist to explore further on these unexplained symptoms. it's important to keep advocating for your health - you know your body best!",2 = poor,some misinformation about IUD treatment for endometriosis
Endo_r5dy3q_post,"I’ve had symptoms of endo since I was basically 13, I’m now 24. It runs in both sides of my family leading to hysterectomies by mid 30s in all the women, so I’ve always suspected I could have it. 

My symptoms have recently escalated to include loss of appetite and rectal bleeding in the last year that have progressively gotten worse. I had a colonoscopy and biopsy of my intestines and they came out clean. My gynecologist thinks based on my pain log and GI results, it’s time to more forward with diagnosing if I have endo.

Option 2. laparoscopy

Option 3. proceed with
treatment by Orilissa with the clinical diagnosis of
endometriosis (she said I don’t need option 1 or 2 to do this) 


I’m leaning more towards option 2 because my main concern is addressing the rectal bleeding as it maybe be an indicator that I have endo on my bowel, which also has run in both sides of my family. 

Have others with bowel endo been able to get it diagnosed with an MRI? Is the laparoscopy as scary as it sounds? 

Any advice, experiences or tips would be greatly appreciated.","sorry to hear about your symptoms and quite understandably it's a tough decision to make. reddit's endometriosis community would probably be a very valuable resource for you to look into about these experiences and decisions.

however, to provide some general understanding, endometriosis is most definitively diagnosed by a laparoscopy. this allows your doctor to visually confirm the presence of endometrial tissue outside of the uterus. mris can sometimes help identify endo, but they are not always conclusive, and it is possible to have endo not detected by an mri. 

on the other hand, laparoscopy is a surgical procedure and does carry potential risks, even though it is minimally invasive. it necessitates recovery time post-operation and the potential for complications during the operation. 

option 3, orilissa treatment, can help manage symptoms of endo without a definitive diagnosis, but may have side effects, and it doesn't confirm whether you have endo or not.

what works best greatly depends on the individual and other considerations like one's overall health, the severity of the symptoms and the willingness to undergo surgery. it's important that you discuss these options with your doctor in detail and feel comfortable with your choice.",4 = good,Negative sentiment towards the medication

option 3, starting treatment with orilissa, is a hormonal medication that can help control symptoms of endometriosis, but it will not confirm the diagnosis or treat bowel endometriosis specifically. it may also have side effects and its effectiveness wanes after stopping the drug.

I've been referred t a gynaecologist but it will be a 1-3 month wait. I'm kinda terrified of the cyst bursting in the meantime too, and how I'm meant to tell if it's burst or if it's ovarian torsion?

1. endometrioma: this is a cyst caused by endometriosis, a condition where tissue similar to the uterine lining grows outside the uterus. endometriomas are filled with menstrual blood and tissue. the presence of a hemorrhagic cyst in the report might suggest an endometrioma, but only a doctor would be able to confirm this.

2. echogenic debris: this term refers to small particles that can be seen on an ultrasound. it can be present in many kinds of cysts and is not necessarily a concern.

3. avascular septae: this refers to thin walls within the cyst that do not have blood vessels in them. the term 'avascular' means the cyst walls don't have their own blood supply. 

4. ""fluid within the pod"": pod refers to pouch of douglas, a space between the uterus and the rectum. fluid here can be normal, but could also be associated with conditions like endometriosis.

5. ""search for pelvic adhesions"": this means they looked for signs of tissue sticking",2 = poor,Does really address her questions about torsion or cyst rupture.

'fine avascular septae' refer to thin, non-blood carrying walls within the cyst, which is common in hemorrhagic cysts.

in terms of your concern about the cyst bursting or ovarian torsion, the symptoms would likely be sudden severe pelvic pain, possibly with nausea/vomiting. any sudden change in your symptoms should warrant immediate medical attention. 

while waiting for your appointment, continue taking the progesterone pill as directed and be observant of any changes in pain or any sudden severe pain. remember, this is only a possibility and it would need further investigation by your gynecologist to confirm. but you should not be in a terrified state as this condition is treatable.",4 = good,"Most hemorrhagic cysts resolve on their own, endometriomas will not."
,,"from the report, the 5.5 cm cyst could possibly be an endometrioma or a hemorrhagic cyst- this can only be confirmed after further testing or laparoscopy. endometriomas are formed when the tissue lining the uterus (endometrial tissue) grows on the ovaries. they are often filled with dark, old blood, giving them the name 'chocolate cysts.' 

hemorrhagic cysts result from bleeding into a functional cyst (a normal, physiological cyst). ""fine avascular septae"" refer to thin non-vascular walls within the cyst, which might be indicative of complexity, but generally, does not increase risk significantly. 

the fluid and debris could be due to a previous cyst rupture or associated with menstrual cycles. this is not usually dangerous but can be a source of discomfort or pain. 

an ovarian torsion would typically cause severe pain and should be treated as an emergency. if a cyst ruptures, you might experience a sudden sharp pain and then a generalized abdominal discomfort but it's usually not an emergency unless the pain is severe or there's too much bleeding.

Endo_5yboff_post,"In Feb. 2015 I lost my left tube due to an ectopic pregnancy. During the surgery, the doctor noted I have adhesions behind my uterus, so that was kind of my unofficial endo dx. My right tube was found to be clear last year as was the inside of my uterus last month. I saw a RE for a time where it was determined I do not have PCOS.

In November 2015 I had extreme pain on my left side, presumably my ovarian area on the second day of my period. My husband took me to the ER and the staff proceeded to treat me like a crazy woman who must've been imagining the pain -or just wanted drugs. About 3-4 hours after the pain started, it went away just as fast; then, I really DID feel like a crazy person. Convinced my pain was gut related, my primary care physician had me get an abdominal scan, which came back clear. 

The next month on the second day of my cycle, I started feeling the same pain and went straight to my PCP, and she realized it was ovarian in nature. Fortunately, the pain only lasted a half hour and didn't get anywhere near as bad as the first time. 

Since then, I hadn't had that same crazy pain as Nov 2015. I've noticed my second cycle day is pretty crampy to the point even ibuprofen can't do much, but that has been all, until two nights ago. 

My husband and I were out of town and I got the same panting, curl up in a ball, agonizing pain as 2015 on my same left side. I didn't really want to go to the ER again to have them stare at me like I'm a jerk, so I ended up lying in the hotel tub for an hour while continuously refilling it with hot water to quell the pain. Once again, after 3-4 hours, I finally had some relief and was able to go to sleep for the night. I've felt normal since then.

Does anyone have any idea what may be causing this pain? I suppose it may be an ovarian cyst rupture, but I thought those were more active mid-cycle. Can endometriomas cause this pain? 

I've spoken to two Gynecologists about this and the general reaction seems to be a shrug, ""it could be a cyst,"" then ""birth control could probably help but I understand you are trying to conceive."" Thanks!","i'm an ai and not a doctor, but i can tell you that cyclic pelvic pain is often associated with conditions such as endometriosis or recurrent ovarian cysts. endometriomas are a type of endometriosis where cysts form on your ovaries, which could potentially rupture, causing sudden and intense pain.

adhesions behind the uterus might also cause discomfort or pain, particularly during a menstrual cycle. the adhesions are bands of scar tissue that can bind organs together, potentially interfering with their normal function and movement, causing discomfort.

additionally, mittelschmerz is a term used to describe pain that can occur during the time of ovulation. this is another potential cause, although typically this pain is more mid-cycle as you mentioned.

again, these are potential causes and none of this information substitutes for a personal consultation with a healthcare professional. it might be best to consult with a reproductive endocrinologist or a gynecologist who specializes in endometriosis. a laparoscopy could provide more definitive answers.",3 = acceptable,"Ok answer, wouldn't start work up with surgery"
,,"yes, endometriomas can indeed cause such pain. endometriosis can lead to the formation of endometriomas, which are cysts that can occur in your ovaries. the severe pain you are describing could indicate a ruptured endometrioma, which can feel very similar to a cyst rupture. 

they are most common during menstruation, but can occur any time within the menstrual cycle. the fact that you continue to experience this severe pain indicates it is something that requires further investigation, because it's also possible the adhesions you mentioned are causing some of this pain. 

a laparoscopy can diagnose if it's endometriosis or not and, depending on its extent, it may be treated during the same procedure. if an ovarian cyst or endometrioma can be confirmed, hormonal treatment might be useful despite your wish to conceive. a multi-disciplinary approach involving a pain specialist and a fertility specialist might also be of help.

birth control is often prescribed to manage endometriomas but as you mentioned, this is not an option if you're trying to conceive. surgery can be an alternative treatment but carries the risk of damaging healthy ovarian tissue. 

as you've noted, the sharpness and duration of the pain are a concern. i would recommend seeking out a specialist in endometriosis or a reproductive endocrinologist who has experience with endometriosis patients. a different doctor might take a different approach and offer more solutions. also, let them know about the frequency and severity of your pain, as this will be important information in finding the right treatment for you.",2 = poor,"Can't really tell from the story that this is an endometrioma, too specific."

the bartholin's glands, located on each side of the vaginal opening, secrete fluid that helps lubricate the vagina. sometimes, the openings of these glands become obstructed, causing fluid to back up into the gland. the result is relatively painless swelling called a bartholin's cyst. if the fluid within the gland becomes infected, you may develop a collection of pus surrounded by inflamed tissue (an abscess).

bartholin cysts or abscesses are quite common and they aren't sexually transmitted, although they can be caused by various bacteria including ones that cause sexually transmitted infections. symptoms may include a tender, painful lump near the vaginal opening; discomfort when walking or sitting; and pain during sexual intercourse. hormonal changes or physical activity don't typically cause bartholin's cysts, but these cysts can become more painful during your period.

,,"i'm sorry to hear about your discomfort. persistent pain, increased frequency of cramps, and abnormal discharge post-laparoscopy for endometriosis are not typically normal. it's important to rule out possible complications such as infection, bowel or bladder injuries or hematomas. the brown and white discharge might indicate an issue like infection or breakthrough bleeding. you should definitely reach out to a healthcare provider. try an urgent care centre or er if you cannot wait until october 21. let them know about your recent laparoscopy and current symptoms, so they can offer the appropriate investigation and treatment. ensure to follow up with your new obgyn as well. continue using your nuvaring as directed until you can speak to a healthcare provider. be assured, help is available, don't ignore your symptoms.",4 = good,
,,"i understand your concern. persistent cramping and abnormal discharge is not typically normal this long after a laparoscopy. if you're noticing that the pain is becoming worse over time and is coupled with abnormal discharge, it's definitely worth being seen sooner. many complications can arise post operation that may not have been apparent immediately. endometriosis is a complex disease, and it's possible that you may have residual disease or the barrier could be causing issues. it's worth putting a call in to your new obgyn's office and explaining your situation. they may be able to get you in sooner or at least provide some advice over the phone. remember - it's important to advocate for your own health. stay strong!",4 = good,
endometriosis_965x9r_post,"I'm currently waiting for surgery for an endometrioma. I've noticed recently that I have no sensation of needing to have a bowel movement. The only sign I get is increased pain. I've learnt to listen to it now, and go to the bathroom. I'm able to go fairly easily when I do, not constipated. Although occasionally there is some diarrhea. But no sensation of needing to go. Is this a known sign of endometriosis on the bowel? I have no problem with peeing. ","changes in bowel function can be a sign of endometriosis, particularly if it's located on or near the bowel. however, the specific symptom of not feeling a need to have a bowel movement isn't commonly discussed in relation to endometriosis. that being said, everybody is unique and so are the ways in which their bodies respond to conditions like endometriosis. it's also possible that this is a secondary symptom related to reduced activity, anxiety, or changes in diet or medication. 

ideally, these changes should be communicated with your healthcare provider. as you're awaiting surgery, it will be helpful to provide your surgeon with as much information as possible about any changes you've been experiencing. also, endometriosis can sometimes cause complications like bowel or bladder problems, usually if the disease is at an advanced stage or if the patient has deep infiltrating endometriosis, which is a severe form of the disease, but these are relatively rare. 

please consult with your healthcare provider as soon as possible to discuss this change. this will help map out the next steps to take to potentially rectify your situation.",3 = acceptable,"Doesn't really sound endometriosis realted, gives to much information including that the endometriosis could be at advanced stages"
,,"endometriosis can potentially invade many organs within the pelvic area, including the bowel, and can potentially cause altered bowel habits. while lack of sensation before a bowel movement isn't a typical symptom of endometriosis on the bowel, every woman's experience with endometriosis is unique. the increased pain you're experiencing could be a signal of bowel involvement, as conversely, bowel endometriosis can often result in painful bowel movements. i would recommend discussing these symptoms with your surgeon or gynecologist before your operation. they may consider a further examination or altered surgical approach if bowel involvement is suspected.",2 = poor,Again makes it seem like she has advanced bowel endometriosis
,,"yes, what you're experiencing could be related to endometriosis on the bowel, known as bowel endometriosis. it can cause symptoms like changes in bowel habits, painful bowel movements, or in some cases, loss of regular sensation of needing to go. this is due to the disease affecting the nerves in the bowel. however, other conditions can cause similar symptoms, so it's important to discuss your symptoms with your doctor. they may perform tests or refer you to a specialist for further evaluation to confirm the cause. even if diarrhoea occurs rarely, it is worth mentioning to your healthcare provider. managing these symptoms can improve your quality of life significantly.",2 = poor,as above
