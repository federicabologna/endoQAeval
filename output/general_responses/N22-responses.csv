urinary tract infections can cause symptoms like urinary frequency and discomfort. leukocytes in the urine can be an indicator of a uti. a low-grade fever can also be a symptom of uti or even a common side effect of bactrim. 

if you see an improvement in your symptoms after taking prescribed bactrim antibiotics, it might suggest that your infection is responding to the medication. however, if your low-grade fever persists, you should inform your doctor because it could indicate your infection isn't fully resolved or you may have a reaction to the medication. 

in general, it's recommended you should report to your healthcare provider how you're doing while on the course of antibiotics, especially if your fever persists and your symptoms don't improve completely. only a physical examination and diagnostic tests can reveal the true cause of your symptoms. 

this advice is intended to be general in nature, and specific causes may not apply to your situation. always consult with your doctor for appropriate examinations, treatment, testing, and care recommendations."
