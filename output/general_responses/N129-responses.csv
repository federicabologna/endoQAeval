N129,no_prompt,"hives, or urticaria, is usually an allergic reaction to something. this could include food, medication, or even external allergens such as grass, dust, and pet dander. sometimes, however, the cause of the hives is not apparent. if your child seems well otherwise without any other symptoms like fever, vomiting, diarrhea, difficulty breathing, swelling of lips/face, and the hives keep disappearing, it could be a mild reaction to something in his environment. 

hives tend to affect different parts of the body at different times. they often come and go, last less than 24 hours, leave no trace when they disappear, and they do not blister. this fits what your child is experiencing at present. 

you should become more concerned if your child develops any systemic symptoms like those i listed above, particularly difficulty in breathing or any swelling of the face/lips. these may suggest a more severe allergic reaction. you should take him to the er right away if he has these symptoms. 

in the meantime, keep a log of when and where the hives appear, as well any potential exposure he may have had. this could help identify a pattern or a trigger. eliminating the trigger, once identified,"
