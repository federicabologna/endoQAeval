N89,no_prompt,"no, this is not normal. experiencing pain to the point of vomiting, sharp vaginal pains, and worsening pain during menstruation over time is not common and should not be ignored. while cramps are normal during menstruation, intense pain can be a sign of a more serious issue like endometriosis or a hormonal imbalance. the intermittent stabbing vaginal pain you're experiencing outside of your period is also concerning. 

given these symptoms, it is advisable to bring this up with your doctor. if they cannot address your concerns, you can ask for a referral to a gynecologist or another specialist. do not be afraid to seek a second opinion if your concerns are overlooked. keep in mind that you should not have to live with debilitating menstrual pain, and there are treatments becoming increasingly accessible to handle these conditions."
