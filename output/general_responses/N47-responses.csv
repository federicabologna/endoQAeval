N47,no_prompt,"i'm a computer program and not a real doctor, but i can tell you that spotting and light bleeding can be normal in the early stages of pregnancy. however, passing blood clots and cramping could be signs of a miscarriage or other complications. 

you should get in touch with your healthcare provider as soon as possible. they may not be able to do an ultrasound immediately, but they can provide medical advice given your situation. even though the ultrasound was normal a day ago, conditions can change rapidly.

the cause of bleeding or other symptoms really can vary, even after a normal ultrasound. other potential causes can include things like implantation spotting, subchorionic hemorrhage, or cervical changes, among others. however, only a healthcare provider can evaluate her situation properly.

please reach out to your doctor immediately about this issue so they can advise based on her specific situation. seek emergency medical attention if the bleeding becomes severe or if she is in intense pain. do not delay in seeking medical advice."
