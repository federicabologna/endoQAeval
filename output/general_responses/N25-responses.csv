it's true that symptoms like diarrhea, weight loss, bloated feelings, and frequent urination can be symptoms of gastrointestinal (gi) cancers, but they could also be due to a range of less serious conditions, such as food intolerance, irritable bowel syndrome (ibs), inflammatory bowel disease (ibd, like crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis), bacterial or parasitic infections, or could even be stress-related.

it's good that you've had a range of tests. if they all came back negative, that significantly reduces the chances of having a serious condition like pancreatic or other gi cancers, but it doesn't rule them out completely. it's nice that you have a monitoring protocol with your healthcare provider.

if your symptoms persist or worsen, it's crucial that you make your doctor aware. you might need further tests, or a referral to a specialist such as a gastroenterologist for further evaluation.

remember to discuss your anxiety about these symptoms with your doctor as well -- psychological distress can contribute to physical symptoms, so it's crucial to address this aspect of your health too."
