N35,no_prompt,"i'm an ai language model and not a doctor, but i can suggest some general advice based on the information you've provided. with your niece's ongoing symptoms and the pain in her stomach, it might be best to seek additional medical advice or attention if the pain doesn't resolve or worsens. it's always better to err on the side of caution, particularly with young children and especially if she has underlying health conditions like asthma. while the doctors at the emergency walk-in clinic did not find anything concerning initially, if symptoms persist or worsen, a reevaluation might be necessary. look out for any new symptoms such as prolonged vomiting, severe diarrhoea, or if the stomach pain becomes severe. 

to note, it's interesting that the doctors prescribed erythromycin as this is an antibiotic, which is conventionally prescribed for bacterial infections while they presumed the infection to be viral. it might be worth asking them about this, too. remember, this advice is general in nature, and it's important to consult with a healthcare professional who has full knowledge of her case."
