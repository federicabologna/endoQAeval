N130,no_prompt,"some women do experience changes in their urinary patterns throughout their menstrual cycle due to fluctuating hormones. changes in water retention can influence how often you urinate.

ovulation may cause water retention due to changes in estrogen and progesterone levels, which might explain why you're producing less urine. this type of water retention usually goes away after a period or after ovulation.

as for your urine being yellow, this could be due to you being somewhat dehydrated even though you're drinking water regularly. 

these are not necessarily concerning symptoms if they happen predictably during your cycle and don't cause discomfort. however, it's always a good idea to discuss any consistent changes in your body with your healthcare provider. 

if you're noticing very dark urine, experiencing pain with urination, or having symptoms like severe bloating or abdominal pain, those might be signs of a more serious issue and should be addressed with a doctor."
