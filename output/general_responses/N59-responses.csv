N59,no_prompt,"i'm an ai language model, not a doctor, but i can offer some advice based on general information. the fact that you've had several illnesses in a short period of time may be related with the increased exposure due to close proximity with infected individuals, your increased stress levels, or a weakened immune system due to your diet. 

anxiety can also exacerbate feelings of illness and cause stress on your body, making it harder to fight infections. however, frequent illnesses can sometimes be a sign of an underlying issue, so it certainly wouldn't hurt to discuss this with your primary care provider.

when it comes to symptoms of leukemia, bruising, bleeding, and shortness of breath are among them, but these diseases can present in many different ways. without any of these symptoms, cancer may not particularly be likely.

in general, it's always a good idea to seek proper medical advice when you're feeling unwell and carry concerns. getting reassurance from a healthcare professional can also help to alleviate your anxiety. so, if you are worried, make an appointment with your pcp to discuss your symptoms and concerns. they will be able to guide you best based on your detailed medical history and symptoms."
