N64,no_prompt,"i'm really sorry to hear about your loss. as an ai, i can provide some possible explanations, but it's really important to wait for the official corner's report to know the exact reasons. from the information you've given, it seems likely that it might have been a case of a traumatic brain injury (tbi), possibly exacerbated by his earlier brain injury. 

when we talk about traumatic brain injuries, these can be mild (like a simple concussion) to severe (like brain bleeds or brain swelling). even after a minor head injury, blood vessels may be damaged, leading to extra fluid in the brain, causing a slow bleed, this can create pressure in the skull and potentially compress the brain, leading to serious complications or death.

your brother's previous brain injury could have left his brain more susceptible to new injuries. a severe injury could cause brain swelling or a significant enough brain bleed that, if left untreated, could certainly be fatal.

however, until the corner's report is issued, these are just possibilities. you should wait for the official report to know the exact cause of death. again, i'm really sorry for your loss."
