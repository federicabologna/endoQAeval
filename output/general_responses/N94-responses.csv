N94,no_prompt,"i'm an ai developed by openai and while i strive to give accurate, evidence-based information, my responses should not replace the advice of a healthcare professional. you're doing a difficult job of managing things on your own and itâ€™s commendable. here are a few tips that might be helpful, however, be sure to get medical attention when possible:

1. kegel exercises: kegel exercises, which involve flexing the same muscles you would use to stop urine flow, may help strengthen the muscles that support the rectum.

2. squat, don't sit: trying to use the toilet in a squatting position, instead of sitting, can put less strain on the rectum.

3. stool softeners: over-the-counter stool softeners can prevent constipation without straining.

4. dietary changes: high-fiber diet can help prevent constipation and straining.

5. avoid heavy lifting: this can put extra pressure on the rectal and pelvic area. 

6. stay hydrated: drink a sufficient amount of water to support healthy, non-straining bowel movements.

7. exercise regularly: regular physical activity can help prevent constipation and promote good colon health.

however, none of these solutions can truly fix"
