N36,no_prompt,"changes in bowel movements can be related to several factors including stress levels, diet, hydration and exercise. if you're eating a different diet (more junk food possibly?) or not maintaining your usual hydration levels now that you're not working regularly, it could explain the changes in your bowel habits. smoking can also affects bowel movements and make you go more often.

it's hard to correlate your head pain medications directly to this, without knowing the exact medication you are on, but certain pain medications can also affect bowel movements in various ways such as causing constipation or diarrhea. 

furthermore, while typically not the first symptom, frequent bowel movements can be a symptom of more serious conditions like inflammatory bowel disease, hyperthyroidism, or gastrointestinal infections. 

if the change in your bowel movements continues or is associated with other symptoms like weight loss, vomiting, severe abdominal pain, or blood in the stool, you should definitely get in touch with a healthcare professional."
