N113,no_prompt,"it's normal to have some sensation changes, such as numbness or tingling after getting a cut, depending on its severity. this could be due to inflammation or slight nerve irritation. however, if the sensation does not go away after a few days, becomes worse, or is accompanied by other symptoms such as swelling, redness, increasing pain, or fever, it would be a good idea to seek medical attention to rule out any possible infection or serious nerve damage. if just uncomfortable, you could try over-the-counter pain medication or a cold pack to numb the area and relieve some of the tingling sensation.
