N30,no_prompt,"your described symptoms resemble a condition called dyshidrotic eczema. this is a skin condition characterized by small, itchy blisters on the hands or feet. dyshidrotic eczema is often seasonal and is usually associated with stress or exposure to certain allergens. however, i would recommend seeing a dermatologist who can examine your skin and provide a proper diagnosis. in the meantime, avoid scratching, try not to burst the blisters, and keep your hands clean and moisturized. do not rely on this advice as a definitive diagnosis, always consult with a healthcare professional."
