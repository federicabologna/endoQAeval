N7,no_prompt,"while the presence of hair in the ear canal might result in certain symptoms such as itching or a tickling sensation, it's unlikely for it to be the primary cause of a persistent tinnitus. tinnitus is usually related to some kind of damage or dysfunction at a deeper level in the auditory system. the fact that your tinnitus symptoms can be modulated by moving your jaw suggests that they might have a somatosensory component, which is common in many people who suffer from tinnitus. 

however, it is indeed possible that the hair touching your eardrum could contribute to your ear discomfort, or perhaps create additional noise that you perceive as part of your tinnitus. this is a topic that you might want to discuss with an ent specialist. 

for sure do not try to remove those hairs yourself! you could cause an injury to your eardrum, which could ultimately result in further hearing problems or potentially increase your tinnitus. 

you should definitely show these images to a healthcare professional who specializes in ear problems (an ent doctor, or ""otolaryngologist""). they can help to explore possible treatments, and as well they have the tools and skills to safely remove foreign bodies from the ear if necessary."
