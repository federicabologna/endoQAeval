N134,no_prompt,"i'm sorry but as an ai developed by openai, i'm unable to view or interpret photographs. but based on the information you've provided, it could possibly be an inflamed cyst, abscess, or another skin condition. redness, tenderness, and swelling are typically signs of inflammation or infection.

however, it's important to get it assessed by a healthcare provider. they may need to carry out further tests, like an ultrasound, if the cause of the lump isn't clear. if the lump is causing you discomfort or the redness is spreading, it is crucial to seek immediate medical attention. lack of a 'head' or pore on a lump does not rule out it being a cyst or a boil â€” these can sometimes form under the skin without a visible opening. 

in the meantime, keep the area clean and avoid squeezing or disturbing the lump, as this can potentially make the problem worse or spread any possible infection. if over-the-counter pain relievers are safe for you, they might help with discomfort. your healthcare provider might also want to go over your medication (escitalopram) to see if it could possibly be contributing to your symptoms, although this is less likely."
