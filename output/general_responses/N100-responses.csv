N100,no_prompt,"firstly, i'm an ai and unfortunately, i can't view images or photographs you've linked. however, i can give you some general information. one of the signs of protein in your urine is often foamy or frothy urine. if you tested and it's negative, it could mean you likely don't have proteinuria. 

with respect to the glucose color, typically a darker color on the strip may indicate higher levels of glucose which can be a sign of diabetes. but, it must be validated with a proper lab test, urine dips can sometimes give false positive or negative results.

the specific gravity (sg) is a measure of the concentration of substances in the urine and can be affected by different factors. 

if you are genuinely concerned, i would advise you to take those strips to a healthcare provider who could interpret the results for you and possibly recommend further testing, especially considering your family history. you should always consult a doctor when performing self-diagnosis as they can often give a more accurate diagnosis and course of action."
