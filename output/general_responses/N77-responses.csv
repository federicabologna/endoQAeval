N77,no_prompt,"it sounds like you're dealing with a tough situation with your hemorrhoid. when your doctor mentions ""draining,"" it could mean that the hemorrhoid has developed a blood clot inside, which can also be called a thrombosed external hemorrhoid. this happens when a blood vessel within an external hemorrhoid becomes engorged and then the blood inside clots. this can make the hemorrhoid feel firm, and it can be very painful.

the procedure for draining a thrombosed external hemorrhoid is usually performed under local anesthesia. the doctor makes a small incision in the hemorrhoid to remove the clot. this provides immediate relief for most people, and the wound typically heals in a week or so. 

however, the procedure does carry risks, including bleeding, infection, and recurrence of the hemorrhoid. it's also typically used only for severe cases because less invasive treatment methods often can alleviate the symptoms.

the back pain and stomach pain you're experiencing might not be directly related to your hemorrhoid. however, the general discomfort and stress from your hemorrhoid might be leading to tension and subsequent back pain. your stomach pain might be related to your diet changes or medications or could be a symptom of another issue.
