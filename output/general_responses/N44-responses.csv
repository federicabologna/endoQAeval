N44,no_prompt,"you really shouldn't eat anything that's not meant to be eaten, toothpicks included. however, panicking won't help the situation. 

if you accidentally swallowed a toothpick, it's likely that it will just pass through your system normally, especially if it was soft, dull, and small as you mentioned. the human body is built to handle this kind of occasional accident. 

what you should be on the lookout for are signs of discomfort or pain, particularly in your stomach or chest, over the next few days. this could indicate that the toothpick is causing problems. nausea, vomiting, fever, stomach pain, or blood in your stool are all serious symptoms that would require immediate medical attention. 

so, in summary, don't panic, but just keep an eye on things and see a doctor if you experience any concerning symptoms. and in future, be sure to remember to remove those toothpicks before you chow down!"
