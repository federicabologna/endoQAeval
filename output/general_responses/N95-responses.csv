N95,no_prompt,"i'm an ai developed by openai, and i'm not a doctor, but based on what you've described, there are a few possibilities. the symptoms you've mentioned, including your stomach discomfort and blood in your urine, could be related to heavy exercise, medication use, or dehydration. it's possible that the ibuprofen may have contributed to stomach discomfort, particularly if you're taking it regularly on an empty stomach. 

dehydration can also cause discomfort and may potentially cause your urine to be darker, though it shouldn't typically cause bloody urine. if you've been doing heavy exercises, you may have induced rhabdomyolysis, which can cause blood in the urine and may result from intense workouts.

in any case, these symptoms should not be ignored. especially the blood in the urine, which can signify a serious condition. it would be crucial to seek medical help. i know you mentioned finances being a significant issue - it might be possible for you to get help at a free clinic or a sliding scale clinic in your area while you apply for medicaid.

remember, this advice is intended to be general in nature, you should contact your healthcare provider."
