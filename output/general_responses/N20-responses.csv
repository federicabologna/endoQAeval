N20,no_prompt,"it could indeed be that your symptoms are worsening on the antibiotics - the antibiotics can take a while to start having an effect. however, if the area of the redness or swelling on the lower leg is rapidly increasing, very painful, or develops any other concerning symptoms like fever, chills, or drainage, you may want to contact the healthcare provider who diagnosed your cellulitis or go back to urgent care. if you've only been taking the antibiotics for a day or two and the worsening is not severe, i would recommend continuing to monitor for a little while longer as sometimes it just takes a little while for the antibiotics to start working. 

also, it's important to keep your leg elevated as much as possible, avoid scratching or rubbing the area and keep it clean. this can help to relieve symptoms and prevent spreading of the infection. 

however, every person is different and it may be best to consult with your healthcare provider to tell them about the change in your condition. they'll be able to give you the best advice."
