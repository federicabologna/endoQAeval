N9,no_prompt,"the symptoms you describe - a rash, joint pain, fever, and elevated inflammatory markers - are compatible with a diagnosis of systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sjia) which is also suggested by the hospital's rheumatology service. sjia is a kind of arthritis that affects children under 16. 

the negative results of infectious workup (including parvo, cmv, ebv, strep culture) and normal findings from cardiology and oncology further support the presumption of sjia, as sjia is a diagnosis typically made after other possible causes have been excluded.

treatment for sjia generally involves managing the symptoms and preventing complications. this might include nsaids, steroids, or medications designed to decrease immune system overactivity called disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (dmards).

i recommend reaching out to your pediatric rheumatologist to discuss her symptoms and possibly starting therapy for sjia. make sure to bring up your concerns about her continued pain."
