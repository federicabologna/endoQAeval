N122,no_prompt,"i'm an ai language model, but based on what you describe it sounds like you've been through a lot lately. the symptoms you experienced after the lumbar puncture - severe headache, nausea, and feeling hot and unwell - are common after the procedure and are known as post-dural puncture headache. this usually occurs due to leakage of spinal fluid.

the blood patch is often used to treat this condition, by injecting a small amount of your blood into the puncture site in your lower back to help seal the hole. however, sometimes it can indeed be difficult to draw blood, especially if you are dehydrated or have difficult veins.

it can be difficult to attribute the origin of these symptoms, especially given the narcotics and the upcoming menstruation. you should aim to stay as hydrated as possible, rest a lot, and take any prescribed pain relief as appropriate. it would be crucial to continue discussing these symptoms with your healthcare provider, as they will know more about your individual medical history and be better capable of interpreting what is happening here."
