N32,no_prompt,"i'm an ai language model and can't physically examine your toe, but it's important to see a healthcare provider if you have an infection that isn't improving. in your case, it sounds like the infection is somewhat controlled, but your toe is still swollen and was draining pus, which could indicate an ongoing infection.

if you've been managing to keep the area clean, apply an antibiotic cream, and it feels better, it may be okay to monitor for another day to see how it progresses. but since you are in pain and swelling, going to the doctor would be appropriate. 

you should also be aware of signs of spreading infection which require immediate medical attention include red streaks leading away from the wound, high fever, chills, increasing pain or swelling, or a wound that doesn't improve after a week.

remember this advice is intended to be general in nature, and specific causes may need different management. it's always best to consult a healthcare provider for appropriate diagnosis and treatment."
