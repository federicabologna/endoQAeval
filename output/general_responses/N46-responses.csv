N46,no_prompt,"based on your description, it's possible that your lingering soft cough is due to inflammation in your respiratory tract that could have been caused by your recent illness. however, it could also be due to smoking, as you mentioned you use recreational drugs occasionally. smoke can irritate the lining of your respiratory system and lead to a chronic cough. given that it has been a few weeks and your cough has not improved, you should reach out to a healthcare professional for assessment. they may recommend over-the-counter remedies, prescribe medication if necessary, or order tests to rule out more serious conditions. worsening or persisting symptoms are always a good reason to seek medical attention."
