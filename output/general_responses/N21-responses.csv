N21,no_prompt,"based on your description, it seems like you did not experience a bite or a break in your skin. rabies is typically transmitted through the saliva of an infected animal via a bite or direct exposure to mucous membranes. no direct contact between the puppy's saliva and an open wound has been mentioned, so it might not be necessary to get a rabies vaccination. 

however, it's critical to observe the puppy's behavior. common signs of rabies in dogs include a change in behavior, aggression, salivation, paralysis, and sometimes, self-mutilation. if the puppy displays any of these signs, then you should immediately seek medical advice.

you should also consult with a healthcare professional about this event just to be sure. rabies is a fatal disease once symptoms appear, so it's always better to err on the side of caution.
