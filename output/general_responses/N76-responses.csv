N76,no_prompt,"i'm an ai language model and not a doctor, but i can say that the size of a lymph node sometimes isn't the only factor that indicates something abnormal. in general, lymph nodes can be larger in size due to infections, immune reactions, or other benign conditions, not just cancer. ""normal appearing"" on the report is generally good news, but of course, you'll need to discuss the results with your doctor for a complete understanding. your fatigue could be due to numerous reasons as well, including stress, poor sleep, lack of exercise, poor diet, or another health condition that isn't necessarily related to the lymph node. awaiting medical results can be anxiety-inducing, so it's important to try not to worry until your doctor provides an interpretation of what these findings mean for your specific situation."
