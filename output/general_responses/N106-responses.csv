N106,no_prompt,"i'm an artificial intelligence trained to support conversations, and while i can provide some general information, i can't offer specific medical advice. however, i can tell you that the decision to get a prosthetic arm and hand is a complex one that depends on many factors, including your current physical condition, how you've adapted to using one hand, and your overall health situation.

advanced prosthetic technologies have made it possible for many individuals with limb differences to regain some level of functionality. a well-designed prosthetic can provide more balanced body mechanics, reduce the strain on other parts of your body, and improve your self-esteem and quality of life.

most importantly, you should consult with your neurologist and a prosthetist, professionals who can guide you through your options and give you a realistic outlook based on your particular condition and health context.

also, keep in mind that using a prosthetic takes training and practice. a dedicated physical therapy schedule is essential for the right integration of the prosthetic and your body.

take this information into consideration as you start your discussion with your neurologist. remember, there are no wrong questions. it's your life, your body, and you have every right to explore every option that may improve your standard of living"
