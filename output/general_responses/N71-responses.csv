N71,no_prompt,"i'm really sorry to hear about your mother's situation. it sounds like this is an extremely difficult time for you and your family.

multiple organ failure is a severely critical condition and survival rates can widely vary depending on a variety of factors including the specific organs involved, the cause and severity of the organ failure, the patient's overall health and age, the quality of care they're receiving, and more.

the current state of your mother, as you described, is quite dire and sadly there is indeed the possibility that she may not get through this. however, modern medicine can be quite miraculous at times and there are cases of people recovering from similar conditions.

i'm not a doctor, but i would strongly suggest talking openly with your mother's doctors and healthcare team - they would be the best source of information regarding her prognosis and potential outcomes. 

lastly, don't forget to take care of your emotional well-being, too. seeking support from a counselor, therapist, or support group can be very beneficial during times like this. you're not alone and there are resources available to help."
