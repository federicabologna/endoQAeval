let's start with your suspicion of herpes. herpes symptoms typically start with itching, burning, or tingling sensations, followed by small red bumps or tiny white blisters. these eventually become painful open sores, which subsequently crust over and heal within 2 to 3 weeks for the initial outbreak, and shorter for subsequent outbreaks. in more severe cases, individuals may also experience flu-like symptoms. 

however, genital sores could be caused by a myriad of reasons, such as irritation from lube/condoms, trauma, or yeast infection. given your past experience with cytolitic vaginosis and thrush, it could indeed be related. yeast infections can cause itching, soreness, and white clumpy discharge. severe yeast infections can cause swelling and sores, but this is uncommon.

if the sores are very tiny and not red, it could be something else entirely, such as folliculitis or skin irritation from excessive bathing/scrubbing. it's best not to self-diagnose or panic. 

seeing a doctor as soon as possible"
