N60,no_prompt,"you should consider investing in a finger splint or even a small finger cast. these could protect the area while still allowing you some mobility. make sure to keep the area clean and dry as much as possible to promote healing. 

as for the liquid bandage, it's typically not recommended for use directly over stitches. however, you can use non-stick dressings or tegaderm (a type of transparent dressing) to cover and protect the stitches. make sure to change these regularly, especially after training, in order to keep the area clean. 

remember to cool down the area if it's inflamed and consume protein-rich food to aid the healing process.

don't hesitate to go to the doctor if the area becomes inflamed, incredibly painful, or shows signs of infection. it's always better to be safe than sorry, and you want to ensure your hand is in the best possible condition for your fight."
