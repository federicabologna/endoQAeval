N132,no_prompt,"although secondhand vapor from e-cigarettes is generally thought to be less harmful than traditional secondhand smoke, it does still contain a number of harmful substances, including nicotine. however, the amount of nicotine you would absorb through secondhand exposure is likely much lower than what a direct user would ingest.

nicotine has a half-life of about 1 to 2 hours, meaning it takes about 10 hours to clear from your system. however, its metabolite, cotinine, has a significantly longer half-life (around 15-20 hours), and can be detected in your system for up to a week after exposure. 

while nicotine does indeed increase the risk of certain complications, it's not entirely clear what effect, if any, secondhand nicotine exposure would have on your surgery or recovery. overall, the amount of nicotine that you're absorbing is likely quite low. however, it would be prudent to discuss this with your doctor who is going to perform the surgery and ask your spouse to not vape around you, especially in the days leading up to your surgery and during your recovery period."
