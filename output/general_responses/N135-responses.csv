N135,no_prompt,"continuing to have unprotected sex can indeed increase the risk of stis. the risk of contracting an sti depends on a number of factors including the type of sexual activity, the infection status of the sexual partner, whether or not protection was used, and the presence of other stis. 

even if you've already had unprotected sex once, the risk of transmission is not certain. not all stis are transmitted with every sexual act, and for some infections, repeated exposure may increase the likelihood of becoming infected. some stis, like hiv, have a relatively low transmission rate per act of unprotected intercourse, but the risk accumulates over repeated exposures.

if you cannot tolerate condoms, it's important to discuss alternate forms of protection with your partner and a healthcare provider. options can include female condoms, dental dams for oral sex, or pre-exposure prophylaxis (prep) for hiv prevention. regular sti testing is also important for both you and your partner to ensure you are making informed decisions about risk."
