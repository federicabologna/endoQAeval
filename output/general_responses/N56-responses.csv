N56,no_prompt,"as an ai developed by openai, i'm not capable of visualizing or interpreting images like a human can. however, i can share some general thoughts based on your description.

a hard, non-moving bump behind your ear could be a number of things including a cyst, a lipoma (benign fat tissue growth), an enlarged lymph node, or a benign bone growth called an osteoma which can occur on the temporal bone behind the ear. factors such as the lump being hard, non-mobile, and not causing pain ordinarily might indicate something benign like a lipoma or cyst rather than cancer.

given it's been present for several years and you're just noting an increase in size now, it's advisable you consult with a healthcare professional. they can physically examine the bump, potentially order imaging or a biopsy if required, and put your worries at ease. only a professional evaluation can diagnose you properly. don't hesitate to book an appointment.

remember, lots of bumps and lumps turn out to be harmless, but it's good to get them checked out for your peace of mind."
