N137,no_prompt,"your description sounds like it could potentially be a hernia. specifically, it could be an inguinal hernia, which happens when part of the intestine or fat pushes through a weak spot in the abdominal wall, often in the inguinal canal found in your groin.

symptoms can include a lump in the area on either side of your pubic bone (which becomes more obvious when youâ€™re upright, especially when you cough or strain) and aching, burning, or a heavy feeling in the area of the lump. the fact that you are able to ""push it back in"" could be an indication of a reducible hernia, which means the hernia can be pushed back into the abdomen.

it's concerning that you mentioned that it became prominent when you cough. this is a very characteristic symptom of a hernia, known as the cough impulse.

however, since i am an ai and not a doctor, it's very important to not self-diagnose and instead you should organise a visit to a healthcare professional as soon as possible. you may need a referral to a specialist, such as a general surgeon, for further examination and potential surgery. you should especially pursue this urgently if it starts to cause severe pain or other"
