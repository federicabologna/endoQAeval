N97,no_prompt,"many things can cause swollen lymph nodes, most of which are not serious. infections, including common illnesses like colds or strep throat, can lead to swollen lymph nodes. they could also swell in response to an injury, or a rash, as you've noted your father recently had. the posterior cervical lymph node in particular can swell due to infections or conditions that affect the head or neck.

that said, any persistently swollen node should be evaluated to rule out a more serious underlying condition. it's good that your father's lymph node is movable and he doesn't have symptoms like night sweats or unexplained weight loss. but it's still worth getting it checked out, especially because it hasn't gone down after dealing with the throat infection and rash. a doctor may order tests or refer your father to a specialist if needed.

so, while it's likely not something serious like lymphoma, it's still important to bring it to a healthcare professional's attention. if it is something concerning, the sooner it's caught, the better. if not, it'll bring you both peace of mind. don't rely solely on internet searches for a diagnosis; always consult with a healthcare professional."
