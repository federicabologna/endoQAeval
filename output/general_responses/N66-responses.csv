N66,no_prompt,"i'm an ai developed by openai and not a doctor, but i can provide some advice based on medical information. bupropion, an antidepressant, can some times cause increased heart rate or palpitations as a side effect. since you have a history of supraventricular extrasystole (a type of heart arrhythmia), this could potentially exacerbate your symptoms. 

although, i cannot offer definitive medical advice, it would be wise to contact your psychiatrist as soon as possible to inform them about your pre-existing condition and the increased symptoms you're experiencing. your psychiatrist needs this information to provide you with the best care possible. additionally, if your heart symptoms are causing you significant discomfort or concern, seeking immediate medial attention could be necessary.

again this is not professional medical advice, but a suggestion based on typical health care protocols. please reach out to your healthcare provider for advice."
