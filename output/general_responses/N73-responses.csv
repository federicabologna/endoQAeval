here are a few essential tests you should consider:

1. **complete blood count (cbc):** this is a basic test that measures different components of the blood, including red and white blood cells, hematocrit, and hemoglobin.

2. **comprehensive metabolic panel (cmp):** this measures your sugar (glucose) level, electrolyte and fluid balance, kidney function, and liver function. fasting could cause drastic changes in these areas.

3. **fasting insulin:** this can give you a better picture of insulin resistance, which is directly related to diabetes and obesity.

4. **lipid profile:** measures various lipids in the blood, including cholesterol and triglycerides. water fasting can significantly impact lipid levels in the body.

5. **thyroid panel (tsh, free t4, free t3):** these hormones govern metabolism, so it could be insightful to see how fasting impacts thyroid function.

6. **vitamin b12 and folate:** fasting could affect the levels of these essential vitamins."
