N79,no_prompt,"while different diet choices can lead to changes in the taste or smell of bodily fluids, the exact cause of your experience is difficult to pinpoint. concerning the sweet taste, one possible explanation could be related to the artificial sweeteners commonly found in diet soda. these sweeteners aren't fully absorbed in your body and can be excreted in sweat and vaginal secretions, potentially causing a sweet taste.

however, a sudden and extreme change in the sweetness of your body fluids can potentially be a sign of diabetes, which can cause high levels of sugar in blood and urine. although you mentioned you are generally in good health, if you notice other symptoms such as frequent urination, unquenchable thirst, unexplained weight loss or constant tiredness, it would be a good idea to see a medical professional.

regardless, i would recommend discussing this with a healthcare provider to make sure it's not indicative of any underlying health issues."
