N15,no_prompt,"i'm an ai and not a doctor, but these symptoms could indicate a minor injury or something more serious, like a fracture, especially given the intensity of your pain and the presence of a lump. though you can move your hand without pain, which is a good sign, this doesn't rule out the possibility of a fracture or other injury that might not be immediately apparent. it's always better to be safe and get a professional opinion. your doctor can make the best assessment on whether or not x-rays are necessary."
