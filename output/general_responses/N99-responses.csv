N99,no_prompt,"i'm an ai model, and i'm really sorry to hear how much you're struggling right now. while i can't replace professional medical advice, i can give you some suggestions based on your symptoms. 

the discomfort in your neck and head could be a combination of tension headaches and poor posture. the lumpy feeling could be a muscle knot, which commonly develops as a result of stress or straining. this might be caused by the way you're sitting or holding your head when watching netflix/youtube or using your phone, especially if you've been still for extended periods. 

the fatigue and random aches in your arms and chest could be related to the stress and anxiety you're experiencing, as fatigue, muscle aches and body heaviness often accompany these conditions. 

the ear fullness can sometimes occur as a result of upper respiratory infections, allergies, or even sudden changes in altitude or pressure, however this also can be the result of having a problem within your middle ear such as eustachian tube dysfunction.

considering that you're really worried and your symptoms are significantly affecting your everyday life, i would recommend that you do contact your general practitioner. they are likely to be best placed to give you the most precise advice for your symptoms"
