N19,no_prompt,"i'm an ai language model, not a doctor, but i can suggest general advice based on your symptoms. it's important to validate your own feelings and experiences, especially if they concern your health. given the severity of the symptoms you've experienced, including possible seizures and migraines, it's critical to get a thorough medical evaluation. 

doctors could perform tests like a neurological exam, brain imaging like mri, or an eeg which records electrical activity in the brain and could detect abnormalities related to epilepsy.

if your doctors refuse to take your symptoms seriously, consider getting a second opinion. in some areas, neurologists or epilepsy specialists are available, and you might want to seek them out.

ultimately, your wellbeing is the utmost priority and you have the right to seek the care you believe you need. it's essential to ensure that you know what to do in case of a seizure, such as staying safe during the episode and having a plan in place for after the seizure, like having someone drive you to the er.

please consult a healthcare professional as soon as possible. your health is important, and it's crucial that these symptoms get looked into."
