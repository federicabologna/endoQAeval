I noticed in at least early August that my 3.5 year old son has a bump on his neck where I believe a lymph node is located. It‰Ûªs been a few months now and it has not changed, if anything it has gotten slightly bigger. It is not present on the other side and is not tender to touch.

I also can‰Ûªt remember if the bump was there before August but I think it‰Ûªs possible.

N7,ybkgqk,"39M.  260 lbs.  Eastern-European ancestry.  I've had tinnitus in my left ear for a couple of years now. I just woke up one night with it, and it has never gone way. I've also sometimes noticed clicking in that ear when I swallow.

My GP has looked inside, said it looked fine, and suggested Eustachian tube disfunction. He recommended nasal steroid sprays, which I tried to no real effect. The tinnitus can be modulated by moving my jaw, and I don't have any history of listening to loud noises or hearing loss. I've also talked to my dentist for TMJ, got a night guard and such, and none of it has helped.

N9,ygilbm,"8F, 78lbs, no medication. She was in the hospital for a long time but they discharged her. She is still in pain, please help. I attached the notes of her discharge.

The patient is an 8-year-old white female with five weeks of fever, rash, arthralgias. Last month, the patient noted foot pain involving both left and right feet, as well as a blotchy pink rash on the leg that proceeded to spread to the trunk and then arms and then face during that week. The patient had low-grade fevers with temps to a max of 101. This has progressed to the week prior to admission higher fevers with T-max of 103.5. The patient has endorsed muscle pain, particularly in the right leg and arm, and PMD had seen the patient this week noted right knee and right index finger swelling. There is no noted weight change over this time period. No noted diarrhea or swollen nodes. The rash the patient described the week prior had an acute abrupt onset and 5-10 minutes later would dissipate.

Rheumatology was consulted on the patient from admission. Lab studies were sent to rule-out an infectious etiology for rash. Strep culture was negative. EKG was also performed to rule-out a prolonged PR interval. EKG was within normal limits. A DNase B antibody was 547 and an ASO titer was 300. While results were elevated, the patient did no meet clinical criteria for rheumatic fever and diagnosis that was most likely entertained was systemic JIA. Further lab work included an ANA which was negative, rheumatoid factor which was negative, a CRP on admission was 8.6 mg/dL with an ESR about 80. CK and aldolase were within normal limits. Ferritin was elevated at 663. LDH was within normal limits. CBC was reassuring with normal white counts, hemoglobin and platelets; findings nonsuggestive of leukemia. Hepatic panel within normal limits. A chest x-ray was done to rule-out mediastinal mass, and that was negative. From an infectious standpoint, Parvo, CMV, EBV were all negative. Clinically the patient was noted to have a salmon-colored transient rash that would come and go throughout the hospitalization lasting a matter of minutes. No definite arthritis on examination. Oncology was consulted given the history of arthritis and fevers. It was felt in the setting of normal cell lines in evaluating a smear, which revealed no blasts, no indication of hepatomegaly or splenomegaly and uric acid and LDH within normal limits and x-ray that was normal, they felt that further oncologic evaluation was not indicated and a bone marrow was not indicated at that time. Cardiology was also officially consulted because the patient had a 2/6 ejection murmur on the exam. Cardiology felt the murmur was a flow murmur and evaluated the EKG, which they read as
within normal limits, and decided an echo was not indicated to rule-out valvular disease in the setting of the rash and arthritis in an attempt to workup acute rheumatic fever.","Doctors please help my little sister, she can't walk, I'm afraid she's going to die 8F, 78lbs, no medication.

I had tingling and burning sensation in my extremities, pain, reduced ability to feel temperature changes... Etc. I didn't much pay attention to it, untill two years ago. It started literally as a painful spot in my upper arm. Below the sholder, above the elbove. The apot wasnt bigger than the size of a avarage coin. It would hurt for few seconds, once in a day, which was weird for me, because it was localised, unlick neuropathy, where i couldnt locate just one painful spot.
It started from a spot and today i cant lift my arm anymore. The pain has spread throught my arm and should. My whole arm hurts, even my fingers. I cant lift arm, up or on the side, i can't put it behind my back anymore. I can barely wipe my glutes, etc, i have developed insomnia, because i cant sleep from the pain. The pain is not always there, but it mostly is. When i am not moving much, it hurts but not that bad. When i try to, for example take off my hoodie, which involes mu right arm to lift, the pain shoots, like someone stabed me. Why am I writing is to ask, if it is possible that this kind of pain is the result of neuropathy. I can use my arm normaly, if i am not raising it, or movimg it. Like if its to my body, i cam write normally, use my phone, tye my shoes, cook etc, but i have to lift it, than the pain is unmanageable and o immediately have to put back, beside my torso.","excruciating arm pain 33F

I don‰Ûªt have insurance at the moment, and I‰Ûªm not sure what doctor to go to for this. It‰Ûªs now painful after this last event and I dread having to go to the bathroom. Id rather not eat anything. 

Do I just go to a walk in clinic and introduce whatever doctor to my best side? Do I need to mention anything when I call to schedule an appointment?

3 or maybe 4 months ago, I noticed that I was pooping less frequently. My diets not the best (cheap junk food and bad balance in general), so I'm no stranger to constipation.

This smell though goes beyond that, and I am constantly smelling it while just passively breathing in. I thought maybe I have some kind of infection somewhere? Besides this though, I've been feeling more tired than normal. I'm an avid coffee drinker so I tried more coffee and that didn't help. No coffee at all, and I felt exactly the same somehow. I'll take a nap and wake up tired. Thought it could be vitamin deficiency but I'm always outside and taking b12s and all that.

N80,yf6kuh,"My (34 F) doctor just called me to inform me about a prenatal ultrasound I had done 2 days ago.

I'm currently 12 weeks, I already had another ultrasound at 8 weeks and everything seemed normal. No issues with the pregnancy so far either.
This additional ultrasound was performed because my doctor told me this pregnancy is considered a ""geriatric pregnancy"".
The technician kept switching the transducer (?) and tried to get the baby to move more to be able to take better pictures. (""The baby is not cooperative"" was what she said.)
Baby was moving and normal heartbeat was measured. Technician printed pictures for me and congratulated me on the pregnancy.

When my OBGYN called today he told me that unfortunately something seems to be wrong with the baby, and asked if I already heard anything from the technician who did the ultrasound (I told him I did not).

He couldn't tell me what medical condition it was, he said that he had never seen this before, the only thing he could tell me was that we need another ultrasound next week to confirm, and that genetic specialists might have to talk to me.
He said that there might have been something wrong with the ultrasound machine, but he sounded so negative on the phone that it made me feel like this pregnancy won't be able to continue. 

When I asked him to be more specific, he mentioned the following
- Cavum Septum Pellucidum (CSP) not seen
- Nasal Bone absent
- Brain is normal size but couldn't see a cerebellum

I googled the CSP and found sites that mentioned it would be difficult to locate before 18 weeks.

I'm devastated right now and find it difficult being left with this information and having to wait for another week, that's why I'm seeking for advise here.

How likely is it that the technician just did a bad job or the ultrasound was not clear enough at 12 weeks, especially considering that so many features seem to be absent on the ultrasound? If the features are absent on the next ultrasound, what genetic disorder does this indicate and should I come to terms with the fact that this pregnancy most likely has to be terminated?
Anything experienced something similar before?

Fast forward to this week, I‰Ûªm having issues again; but worse-

Monday: I went to the ER because I‰Ûªve been getting some messed up vertigo symptoms. I felt very off. They told me the vertigo was related to my bp &amp; hr dropping and going up upon position changes (think they mentioned POTS?)

Tuesday night: I pass out at home after feeling light headed for a while. 
This time (unlike times in previous years) I am out, unconscious on the floor. When I wake up I get told my eyes were fluttering and I wasn‰Ûªt responding. I was out maybe 3 minutes. I still had trouble speaking after waking up.

Wednesday morning: I got to work, my head was killing me in one specific spot in the back of my head for a few hours. Pain started to get intense, started getting heart palpitations, light headed was returns- BOOM, hit the ground - unconscious yet again. One of my co-workers found me, I wasn‰Ûªt responding and I was randomly twitching. My eyes were open but fluttering again. He called an ambulance and once the medics got there (literally within 2 minutes) they tried to wake me up but I wasn‰Ûªt responding still. I was in and out by this point but I couldn‰Ûªt speak or move. I heard him say my eyes were all over the place, next thing I knew he was digging his knuckles into my sternum and that mostly got me conscious again. When I opened my eyes I was dead confused and felt like I was about to slip out again. They brought me to the hospital and the doctor was ready to chalk it up to a migraine until it happened again while she was right next to me. 
Then she decided I needed to be seen by neurology and I was admitted. 

While I waited a few hours for neurology, the nurses noticed my eyes, tried to wake me up but I was again unable to speak or move. More knuckles into my sternum.
They got a rush order for an EEG (still took a few hours to get) but they only did it for about 35 mins and that was with breaks because I had to keep using the bathroom. Once the test was done and read- they said it came back normal and that it was not seizures. I was told it was Vasovagal syncope + vertigo and potentially POTS Syndrome. 

Friday: took day off from work to rest as I felt off still. 

Today at work: started to get odd sensation in back of my head like a tickle or skin crawling feeling almost that moved into back of my neck. Started to feel a bit of twitchiness. Feeling got more intense in my head and I felt myself checking out again. My co worker made sure I was safe and tried to wake me up. He said my eyes again were all over the place and fluttery, and this time I was super twitchy. He had to give me a few minutes after I was awake again because I still couldn‰Ûªt speak right after.  

I just got a notification that the EEG report posted to my portal so I looked at it (even though I am aware I was told it was normal). I read it, it says ‰ÛÏNo epileptiform abnormalities are appreciated‰Û�(I.e-normal), but in the beginning of the report it‰Ûªs says ‰ÛÏsubsequently witnessed to have episode of R head turn and unresponsiveness c/f seizure.‰Û� 

I know I‰Ûªm not a doctor, I have no clue about any of this, but I feel like I need medication. My body feels SO exhausted after every episode and it‰Ûªs draining me.I just need to know what the hell is going on or what I should do. I‰Ûªm also taking a break from driving for now to be safe. 


I‰Ûªm seriously at a loss. 
It keeps happening and I keep feeling specific things before it happens. 

Please shed ANY light on this. I have a child to chase around and need to get better.","What other kind of testing do I ask for following recent admission to hospital &amp; receiving negative EEG after multiple fainting episodes??

N93,y2cyht,"Hello,

I (26M, 179cm, 59kg, no smoking/alcohol/drugs) recently went to a clinic because I tend to black out after mild exertion, (like running to the bus), and had an ECG. The results were apparently a bit unusual with a T-wave inversion in V1-V2. After consulting a cardiologist my Dr. told me this could be a sign of either:

A previous heart attack, or 
A natural phenomenon that can be seen in young, tall, skinny people.

This fascinates me, because those two possibilites feel about as far apart as you could get. While I certainly fit the latter category, severe coronary heart disease runs in the family so I am a bit nervous.

I will be having a bunch of tests done sometime in the near future, but out of curiosity I've been reading about this to try and understand why a result like this could indicate two such different things.

As far as I can gather, the inversion is present after an infarction due to electrically dead scar tissue. But it is also common in children and can sometime remain into early adulthood. I can't find any info on why this happens in kids though, and would be grateful if anyone with some insight could explain.

Thanks!","ECG T-wave inversion? Hello,

N95,xzb81p,"[23M], 5‰Ûª11‰Û�, 211lbs, Hispanic 

So I‰Ûªm training for a fight And have been for a while. But Friday morning I had a two hour sessions ahead of me and I woke up with my legs hurting so I went straight to the pantry and grabbed 3 ibuprofen and took them. I then made some coffee and ate some eggs and left. I had only drank a couple sips of water. 

The training session was exhausting as usual. But I always push through. I chugged some water beforehand and during the sessions but not too much. During the training, my stomach started to hurt for some reason. It wasn‰Ûªt pain, more like discomfort. Well. After class I got home, peed and couldn‰Ûªt help but notice it was slightly red. I started chuggin water making sure I was crazy and the next one was more red but not thick red. Pee with some color. Then I kept chuggin water trying to filter it out. The third one was clearer which was good to me. Then the fourth was gone. I‰Ûªm no longer peeing bloody but I can‰Ûªt help but notice that my stomach feels discomfort after I eat now. I‰Ûªm also getting full a bit easier. Which is throwing me off. 

I asked a nurse friend and they said possibly a stomach ulcer from dehydration. But I‰Ûªve also heard people getting ulcers from ibuprofen. So what does it sound like it could be? How do I help myself? No health insurance and can‰Ûªt afford it. Might apply for Medicaid but until then, I got to do it on my own.","Peed blood a few times [23M], 5‰Ûª11‰Û�, 211lbs, Hispanic

So I am a 21-aged F, 5‰Ûª5. My weight is 123 pounds. I have no current physical medical issues (that the doctors have been able to find) but I have anxiety + depression. Not currently smoking (I did moderately w friends (in a blue moon) but have completely stopped. Also completely stopped alcohol. Am currently sexual active. 


Symptoms the past week I‰Ûªve been experiencing 
- tension/tightness on the back of my head and neck (it honestly feels heavy for me to hold up my head); I‰Ûªve touched the back of my neck (left side) and there‰Ûªs a lump, when I press down it aches/hurts
- headache traveled across the front of my head but stopped 
- tiredness/the morning I felt fatigue and my body felt exhausted, like difficult to move my body 
- left ear feels filled up w a liquid, right ear also 
- throat sometimes hurt randomly, but would stop 
- GI related stuff, been taking meds and it‰Ûªs been fine. Had a panic attack yesterday though and it felt tight 
-left + right arm yesterday hurt randomly at times, but stopped 
- left breast/chest gets tender sometimes. Maybe itchy? 

Habits / things I‰Ûªve been doing 
- watching YouTube/Netflix - with my neck held up by my hand, body crouched, I‰Ûªd also look down at my phone with my neck curved, also sleeping with elevated pillows 
- have been stationary past few days
- sleep had been very very bad* - went to bed at 6am 2 days ago woke up at 12pm. Today I slept at 3:30am, woke up at 10pm. For 2 months I‰Ûªve been sleeping with my night lamp on. 
-poor to little to no excercise

Current moment
Neck/back of headache has gotten worse and I‰Ûªm lying down when typing this out. What should I do? I‰Ûªm thinking of getting an MRI to rule out anything dangerous and want to talk to the PCP about it, but also thinking of going to the ER and getting on there also.

He ordered a retest a month later because he said its abnormal for people under 30 to have high TSH and he wants to check it again before starting meds.

If its abnormal, why? I thought people have thyroid problem above 50.

He also said i need more protein but i eat chicken EVERY DAY, twice a day and eggs at least once a week if not more. [i dont eat green leafy vegs, but i do eat others like carrots, potatoes and many others]

N106,y5vob2,"I'm a 32 year old female, 5'1, 135ish lbs. When I was 6, my doctors discovered a large AVM (arteriovenous malformation) in my brain. They did three bouts of gamma knife radiation and got rid of a lot of it, though not all. It's still large, but stable. However, from the radiation, I had a blood vessel collapse. This gave me a stroke in which I have partial paralysis on my right side. 

Through my adolescent years, I went to both physical and occupational therapy. They saw improvement, but with me being a kid/preteen/teenager, I wouldn't really do exercises at home,  therefore the improvement that they saw pretty much faded. 

Now, in my 30s, I've pretty much given up on my right side. I can still feel on that side. I can walk, but with a limp. My arm is bent up and barely able to straighten. My fingers are always closed. They get tighter and my arm bends even more when I'm stressed. I have two little kids and a husband to care for and a part time job at a daycare. I finally started getting SSDI a few years ago. I've tried therapy a few times but it seems to barely help, especially considering how it helped before. I've greatly adapted to using only one hand for everything possible and it infuriates me when I have to admit that I need help with something that anyone else can do. 

Would I be a possible candidate for a prosthetic arm and hand? I'm so terrified that everything I do with just my left hand will cause it to wear out quicker than average. And just the thought of being able to finally use my right hand -- open the door, hold the steering wheel, even just scratch an itch while I browse my phone. It's an amazing feeling, but I don't want to get ahead of myself just to be disappointed. Of course I'm not going to go into this immediately. I'm going to do a pros and cons list, talk to my neurologist when I visit him in December, etc. But right now, I just want to know: would this be an option for me?","I'm a 32 year old female, 5'1, 135ish lbs.

N107,xutt82,"I'm a 61-yr-old female. Nine months ago, I had a sudden crippling pain in my hip upon exiting my car. Since that time, I've had bouts of pain ranging from mild to incapacitating. The pain is not always the same type or in the same place. It has seemed to be in the hips, glutes, lumbar spine, sacrum, and my lower sides. It can be sharp, tingling, achy, and radiating. I seem to have no core strength at all anymore, and have great difficulty just turning from my side to my back. It feels like my entire pelvic region is disintegrating and can't respond to signals from my brain. At times, I can barely walk, and standing up, bending over, or lowering my body to sit can be excruciating. My lower glutes feel like they're made out of lead when I stand and begin to walk. Arthritis is a definite, and my MRI revealed stenosis and bulging discs bad enough for lumbar fusion to be recommended, but I'm not convinced to go that route yet. Caudal and SI joint injections haven't helped. PT hasn't helped, nor have muscle relaxants or analgesics. I'm just really puzzled by the way the pain moves around and varies from week to week and how it sometimes goes away almost entirely but then roars back and completely incapacitates me for days at a time. That doesn't make sense to me. My mind goes to cancer, but I'm a hypochondriac and keep telling myself something would have tipped my docs off to that by now. But is that the case?

Hey! For 2-3 years now i have had a very low pulse imo. In the beginnig of this i didnt eat much and i went from 86kg down to 55kg, because of health anxiety. Im much better now. Im not super athletic at all, i only go for 1-2 walks a day for 1 hour +. I dont work atm and im usually at home. Last BP was 130/66. I had 2 ECGs in july, they were good. 

So, i can have a full blown panick attack and my pulse will still be like 46-60 and i breathe very slow, feels like i cant ""normally"" breathe faster. My pulse increases when i stand and when i walk etc and ive had like 166 when walking up a hill, i never get tired, and i walk fast. 

Peak Flow Meter is 500-600 and my Spo2 is always 97-99%. The problem is that it just feels so weak and slow when im wide awake and have panick attacks, shouldnt it go up when im like that, and hyperventilate? Im the complete opposite. My doc told me its alright, i have been there several times, and my heart and lungs sounds fine. She told me that i had no need to go to a cardiologist unless i started passing out occasionally etc. 

Why is it like this? Am i just in better shape then i think? The anxiety one is just weird for me. I have GERD and alot of muscle tension throughout my body. Im usually not dizzy when i have low pulse, i feel alright, just scared and anxious about it. Been hard to breathe these 3 years but always normal Spo2.

Hello, my son (6) has a rare genetic/peroxisomal disorder and is completely dependent on us for everything. He has no head control and is very much like a baby in terms of his activity and self care.

We are constantly wiping his face and at night he coughs/gags and we use a suction machine with a little sucker attached to clear out his mouth and nose.  

He previously was on Robinol to help halt the secretions but he had bad side effects and we stopped.  His ENT recommended a cough assist machine which we use but feel like it does nothing.

This morning when I woke up, I used the bathroom like normal and then when I went to wipe, I noticed some blood on the toilet paper. I wiped again, lots of blood (bright red) on the toilet paper. I look in and see blood on or in stool as well (medium red) 

I read online that if it is in the stool, that is bad bad not good.

My SO 31F - Healthy in all aspects outside of fertility concerns, decided to freeze her eggs, in fear that she would have greater difficulties in the future to conceive. She met with many specialists,  was told it would be very unlikely to impossible for her to conceive naturally in the first place and went through the process (Prep, prenatal vitamins, birth control, hormone injections, retrieval, etc). 

They were only able to harvest a handful, and she had planned to kick off additional cycles in the near future (after a cycle or 2 break)., The additional cycles are no longer needed at the moment, as she became naturally pregnant immediately after that first cycle. 

**Questions:**

* Do the provided hormones linger into the following cycle, or are they depleted during the egg retrieval?

* Is it possible they helped?

* Does this happen frequently? In regards to the cycle following a retrieval and/or after being just told that it would be impossible? 

* The one answer I do now have - A condom should always be worn, no matter what your told..

No smoking or drinking. No medications.
Lots of vitamins:)

I‰Ûªm set to have surgery in two weeks to remove a large fibroadenoma. I am asking to forgo the typical iv antibiotics given during surgery as I am a carrier of c diff and have extreme reactions anytime I take antibiotics (months of diarrhea , depression, racing heart, and anxiety)

Is this dumb? Am I going to get a crazy infection that needs antibiotics anyway?
How risky is this and what can I do to reduce the risk of infection because as I mentioned - I die every time I have to take abx.

Thanks docs","33 female - 135 pounds -5‰Ûª6‰Û�

N131,xzqrvh,"I am 45/F/5‰Ûª3/180ish. I have been deaf since birth, progressively. Taking Prozac 20mg, Wellbutrin 150mg, Propranolol prn. In 2013 (age 35) I got a cochlear implant in my right ear. All was going well until I started having facial twitching when wearing the device and shocks inside my head. After some back and forth with my clinic I decided to just stop using it and move on. 

Since then I‰Ûªve had the following symptoms slowly grow worse or become more consistent. I‰Ûªve been diagnosed with depression, anxiety, slightly enlarged left thyroid, generalized fatigue/hypersomnia. I saw an ENT in Nov 2021 who felt a lump on the right side of my neck and had a CT done. My complaints and reason for seeing the ENT included headaches, neck pain, very visible asymmetrical swelling on my right neck/jawline, mild swallowing difficulties/chronic cough (I‰Ûªve had a cough since 2019). These were the findings:

2021 FINDINGS: No definite CT evidence of a discrete mass within the right parotid gland. No definite evidence of disproportionate enhancement, radiopaque calculi or ductal dilatation to the parotid gland on the right. Submandibular glands, muscles of mastication, tongue, floor of mouth, pharynx, larynx appear unremarkable. No definite enlarged lymph nodes within the neck. Few phleboliths noted within the palatine tonsils. Asymmetry in the size of the thyroid glands with the right appearing larger than the left. No definite CT evidence of a discrete nodule within the thyroid. Streak artifact coursing through the thyroid from the patient shoulders. Nasal septum deviated to the right with a prominent spur abutting the inferior turbinate. Paranasal sinuses appear unopacified. Partial mastoidectomy changes noted on the right with a metallic device extending into the middle ear cavity incompletely seen on this study. Partial opacification of the remaining inferior mastoid air cells. Prominent degenerative changes within the cervical spine most pronounced at C5-C6 and C6-C7. Mild to moderate neural foramina narrowing on the right  at C5-C6.

IMPRESSION:
1. No definite CT evidence of a discrete mass within the parotid gland.
2. Mild nonspecific enlargement of the thyroid on the right relative to the left.
3. Partial mastoidectomy changes noted on the right with a metallic device extending into the middle ear cavity.

_____________
My ENT wrote ‰ÛÏno discreet mass was noted. I think it was fullness of the SCM in that area you are feeling. Have a nice day!‰Û� The doctor then rejected my request for a follow up appointment. I didn‰Ûªt feel a lump, she did! I went in for neck pain and headaches and she found the lump. 

I wrote down everything I‰Ûªve complained about in the last five years and finally made the connection this was all probably due to cochlear implant failure/migration. I don‰Ûªt see the doctor frequently (why bother?) but when I do they give me more antidepressants. I had bad anxiety for awhile in 2020, but have no emotional or cognitive complaints. 

After a month and 11 follow up calls I finally got an appointment to begin the removal process at Mayo Clinic, where it was implanted. I am also having a sleep study done in November. I had a home one done and have mild apnea (6 incidents per hour) that shouldn‰Ûªt be making me fatigued/hypersomniac. 

I need someone to review the big picture and let me know if I sound crazy. I want to know if all of this will go away with the explanation or if I‰Ûªm doomed to have a fat right jawline and neck for the rest of my life. I also want to know how mad I should be at my doctors.

N141,y8zk3t,"29M 5'8"" 165lbs. Don't smoke, drink or do drugs.

On 10/14 I had 3 wisdom teeth removed. My top 2 wisdom teeth had been emerged for years, my bottom left tooth was impacted and had began an infection 1 week prior, and I di not have a lower right wisdom tooth.
All 3 were extracted on 10/14. I've been healing well and careful with what I eat, only eating more solid foods in the last 2-3 days.

When my infection started I was prescribed amoxicillin 500mg 4x/day. I did that until my surgery, after which I was prescribed penicillin 500mg 4x/day. I had taken the penicillin up until 2 days ago, when I stopped (so 4-5 days after surgery). I don't like the harmful, sometimes permanent effects that destroying your gut microbiome can have and I want to mitigate that as much as possible.

I started getting paranoid about getting an infection in the lower left again and I took a penicillin, thinking I'd run it for another 2-3 days. But then I thought, what if I broke a pill and placed it gently directly on the socket that I'm worried about.

Would this be effective at treating it locally and mitigating the systemic effects of the antibiotics? As I said, I have both amoxicillin and penicillin, if one is somehow better than the other.

To be clear, I am asking about the efficacy of my proposal. I'm not interested in hearing about how some of you might think that the gut microbiome is a non-factor.

PS: Is there a better of the 2, between amoxicillin and penicillin to use for my situation? Be it orally or my proposed topical solution?","29M 5'8"" 165lbs. Don't smoke, drink or do drugs.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for taking the time to read this.

I have been pursuing a long distance relationship for around 4-5 months with a wonderful woman. We plan to meet  soon, and she told me quite recently that a while ago on one of her screenings (way before we met)  she  has HPV. She seemed pretty upset about it. (Her last partner berated her for it)

She mentioned that it means she has a higher risk of getting cancer, and she has a wart on her finger because of it? Her doctor didn't elaborate on exactly what type etc and i have no idea if it will go away? Her doctor also told her she doesn't have to inform partners about it.

I am a 30yr old man, and have not had any vaccines for HPV. (I didn't even know about it)

&amp;#x200B;

My question is, what do i do? What affect will it have on me? If i get vaccinated against it can i still catch it? It seems the majority of what i have seen seems to say that most people will have it in some form, and it's nothing to worry about really.
