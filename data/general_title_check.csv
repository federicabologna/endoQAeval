N19,xy6ur0,"First T/C seizure, then first migraine less than 3 weeks later? So, on September 17 I (21F) had an unprovoked, tonic clonic seizure. The morning of, I woke up at 7am to a bad headache above my right eye that was also on the back of my head on the left side. I had some snacks thinking it might be hunger, no improvement. I later took 600mg ibuprofen, also no improvement. I was putting in an earring (which I‰Ûªve never had a problem with shots, piercings, excision biopsies, etc and i was not nervous or had locked knees or w/e) and after putting it in I immediately got dizzy with tunnel vision. Luckily, my boyfriend was there and held onto me, as I have fainted before and could tell it was coming. I went unconscious seconds after he grabbed me. This is where I know it wasn‰Ûªt fainting: He said my body stiffened and I was still standing while unconscious, I let out a groan, and then mainly my upper body began convulsing. He laid me down in the hallway and the convulsions calmed down. He said at that point my face was turning blue and he thought I needed CPR, so he began compressions. By the third one, I was waking up as if from a deep sleep, and tried to shove him off as if I wanted 5 more minutes. The first thing I could think was how sore I was, as if I went to the gym the day before. I hadn‰Ûªt opened my eyes yet or tried to speak, my hearing seemed muffled. Then I opened my eyes and was able to begin talking within a couple seconds. I had immediate, intense anxiety and was extremely exhausted, also crying for no reason? maybe fear? My headache was also much worse. This has never happened to me and as much as I wanted it to just be fainting, I know its not. I‰Ûªve fainted a handful of times in my life and it‰Ûªs never had any other events/symptoms like this did. I didn‰Ûªt know i was supposed to go to the ER, because I didn‰Ûªt realize it was a seizure. But I told a telehealth Dr what happened and they said it was a tonic-clonic seizure. I went to a NP at my physician office and she just won‰Ûªt believe me and said i just fainted. So i feel discouraged.
Yesterday, 10/6, I had my first migraine. It began an hour after waking (~10am) above my right eye near my hairline. By 5pm the whole right side of my face hurt, I had intense sound/light sensitivity, felt dazed, dizzy, lightheaded, muffled hearing, ear pressure, and had some vision changes like blurs/lights. It has also followed into today, 10/07.
My parents and the NP have discouraged me of my own experiences and it‰Ûªs making me feel crazy for thinking this needs to be checked out. I just need a professional to hear this and hopefully give me insight. I don‰Ûªt want to find out it‰Ûªs too late if I don‰Ûªt do anything, but my family has always treated me as if i‰Ûªm faking illnesses, even though i never have and have never been dramatic in any way. please help. i‰Ûªm still on their insurance, so that‰Ûªs why it‰Ûªs important.

thank you.

TLDR: F21 has unprovoked, first TC seizure 09/17. First vestibular migraine 10/06 into 10/07. Any relation or cause for concern? Parents won‰Ûªt take me seriously. Please and thank you.","So, on September 17 I (21F) had an unprovoked, tonic clonic seizure.

N63,xttd8l,"23M - Colon cancer? Hi there, I've been noticing some strange things with myself lately, and doing a quick search online lead me to suggestions that I might have colon cancer. If this is the case, I can't afford treatment, let alone a doctors visit. Here's  what's been going on though, and apologies for TMI. 

3 or maybe 4 months ago, I noticed that I was pooping less frequently. My diets not the best (cheap junk food and bad balance in general), so I'm no stranger to constipation. So it wasn't anything new. When I was pooping though, and still to this day, the smell is this sickening weird death smell that I haven't had before until now, and the same thing for passing gas. No blood though, or any serious stomach pains which I read is a possible symptom of colon cancer. 

This smell though goes beyond that, and I am constantly smelling it while just passively breathing in. I thought maybe I have some kind of infection somewhere? Besides this though, I've been feeling more tired than normal. I'm an avid coffee drinker so I tried more coffee and that didn't help. No coffee at all, and I felt exactly the same somehow. I'll take a nap and wake up tired. Thought it could be vitamin deficiency but I'm always outside and taking b12s and all that. 

Idk. It would be simple for me to just get looked at because something's clearly up, but I dont't have the finances for anything like chemotherapy or a colonoscopy. If anyone has some words I would definitely appreciate it.","Hi there, I've been noticing some strange things with myself lately, and doing a quick search online lead me to suggestions that I might have colon cancer.

N68,xtu1o1,"Ear drum ruptured, how long is leaking normal? 35M. Had some pain in my ear yesterday and went to an urgent care and my thoughts proved true as I was diagnosed with an ear infection. Got put on 1000mg of amoxicillin 2x daily for 10 days. Very shortly after the pain began to increase exponentially, and a few hours later, after holding a heating pad to it for a bit, I noticed that water draining feeling in my ear as well as that sound, and saw some clear fluid coming out. Over the next couple of hours that liquid turned to pus and a bit of blood. I read online that when a rupture happens from an ear infection, they‰Ûªll mostly just prescribe antibiotics which I am already on, and the ear drum should fix itself in 1-2 weeks. My question is how long should it be leaking pus? How much can possibly be in there? Because I‰Ûªm about 16 or so hours removed from the rupture and it is still leaking pus sort of heavily. Googled articles say 1-3 days but that seems like a lot, considering the amount that‰Ûªs coming out? Can anyone let me know what‰Ûªs up and what‰Ûªs typical?","35M.

N96,xx1mvt,"(26M) When's a valid age to go get checked for cancer? 
I suffer a lot of health anxiety as a hypochondriac, and big triggers for me is fearing stuff like cancer or heart problems. I always wonder whether i should go get a full body checkup at my age?

I have googled this question and I get a lot of mixed responses.

 I'm not sure if it's a valid thing to do or should only really be done past a certain age. I live in the UK so stuff like checkups are free if I pester the clinic enough.","I suffer a lot of health anxiety as a hypochondriac, and big triggers for me is fearing stuff like cancer or heart problems.
