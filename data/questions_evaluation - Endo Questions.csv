Then after I use the bathroom I still have the sensation of needing to pee. I definitely don’t have a UTI. I also drink a lot of water consistently, but it’s just a weird feeling. I pee often and then afterwards I have bladder pain or I feel like I still need to go. Do you think it’s the scar tissue on my bladder from the Endo??",manifestation,,,FALSE

endometriosis_dn70ay_post,"Hello.  Where do I start?  I had bad cramping as a kid into teens to the point of missing school.  It got better into my adulthood.  I'd only have a bad one every now and then.  Now flash forward to 35 years old and I'm suddenly getting bad cramps to the point of drooling nausea into the trash can.  The pain is so bad I just want to end it all.  Not that I would but those are the thoughts that come in my head.  It's absolutely excruciating. At the end of it, my body is exhausted and shaking.  It happened Jan of last year, March of this year and the last two months in a row.  I finally found an amazing Dr. Thanks to my sister (who has endo) and he did an ultrasound.  Found nothing so he offered to do a laparoscopy or take the pill.  All I have for endo symptoms are the pain-  shouldn't I have more going on for it to be that? It's usually on the second day but then that's it.  The surgery is costly and I'm scared of it.  However, I'd like to rule endo out or confirm -or is that silly when endo therapy is the pill anyway?

Endo_9l74lm_post,"Hello gorgeous people, after my first laparoscopy a month ago I have so many questions because everything I am experiencing is uncharted territory!

I had spotting after surgery, then it stopped, then I got quite painful bleeding with clots (dark blood). I assumed this was my “period” and after a few days it stopped... then four days after that I got insane bleeding! Woke up with bright red blood all over everything, and the pain has been ridiculous. I wake up through the night with extreme back pain.

I have a retroverted uterus so I am wondering if this is why the pain is shooting to the back? Also I am using a moon cup, could this be causing the extreme pain? (Moon cup because I am bleeding extremely heavily).

endometriosis_o94lqw_post,"Hi everyone. This is me asking for advice really, but I failed to do this without ranting thus marked it as so just in case.

A few years ago I had an ovarian cyst burst, had an immediate surgery to remove the cyst, got diagnosed with endometriosis and started taking birth control pills. Plus I had hormone problems - around that same time I had a lot of really bad acne, dark hair on my arms and all of that stuff.

At first I was put on Yarina and a 10-day course of hormones, it was terrible, I could barely get up that month so I quit as soon as the pack was finished (then my period wouldn't stop, but my doc gave me a treatment to fix it). After that I did a blood test to check Yaz+ compatibility, and ever since then I've been taking it. Thank God, it seems to help.

The only problem is that gradually after starting Yaz+, I started having weird flu-like symptoms. My on-going theory for this has to do with lactose in Yaz+ ingredients - I'm not intolerant in the traditional sense, but when I was a teenager, I discovered by accident that going off dairy clears up my acne. I stopped eating dairy and after a few years, I started noticing that if I do accidentally eat something with dairy in it, I wake up with a sore throat or my nose being stuffed. I still don't eat dairy, but after beginning Yaz+ I started to get sick in the summer, I'm hysterically scared of any wind or AC becaue it resuts in something like sinusitis (at first during the winter I couldn't even ride in the car or be in certain buildings because the ""headache"" was so bad). Clearing out my sinuses and being on a very strict healthy diet helped with this, but I'm still not doing things like a normal person - leaving all windows open gave me a headache at +39 degrees celsius just now, which is hilarious. I can't go into grocery stores in the summer without a hood. It should be noted naturally my immunity system was a bit weak in my teenage years, but before Yaz+, I distinctly remember doing stuff like sitting next to an open window for the whole night at -20 degrees Celsius and having no problems with the flu.

So, considering there seem to be no birth control pills without lactose in them, is there something that could be done? Any alternatives to keep endometriosis and cyst growth at bay? One of the docs told me if I stop, the old symptoms would come back, but I don't know.

I often feel very depressed around the time of my period (well, Mirena ‘period’). The best way I can describe it is like the life is being drained out of me. I feel a deep heaviness in my bones and lose all desire to do anything, but this usually resolves after a few days. I assume it’s hormonal.

I’m currently having a pretty bad flare-up and I’ve been in a lot of pain in my pelvis, back, legs and chest every day for the past month. I’ve noticed my mood has been consistently bad throughout, with the ‘life drained out of me’ feeling almost constant, as well as fatigue and irritability/short-temperedness.

I know pain is depressing obviously, but this feels very much like my hormonal mood swings. I’m not feeling any more down than usual about the pain if that makes sense.

- Painful bowel last period - I noticed my last period was particularly painful in during bowel movements. Usually I've noticed bloating and pain in bowels on only the first day of menstration, however this month I continued to have painful bowels during the entire 7 days. 

- Usually the first day of mensuration has always been painful and only drugs+heat+sleep is the only way to relieve the pain. I do sometimes skip work/school as needed. After the first day I usually do not feel any pain.

- My cycles vary from 30 to 32 days. They were 28 days exactly until about one year ago.

Why can't they just give me something stronger post-op? They're also not taking my bleeding disorder seriously. I've told them twice that I'll need a platelet infusion prior to surgery. They just tell me it'll be fine and they'll check my platelets before the surgery...except that's not how it works. I have plenty of platelets, they just don't function well enough to clot properly.

Endo_kr7r8e_post,"Hi everybody. I know this isn't new to most of you but I have been feeling so terrible lately. I've have 3 bouts of pain/ fatigue in the last year. 

The first time they treated me for anemia after iron was low on blood test. The second time they figured it could be sleep apnea and sent me for a sleep study which I did end up having sleep apnea. I currently use my machine every night and my sleep score has been great. The third time and the worst happened this week. Fatigue hit last Monday and I've been in constant ovary and back pain as well. All I've been doing is laying in bed, overly emotional, irritable and in pain. 

Over the weekend my fatigue was so bad I had trouble walking around the house. I got worried it could be serious and went to ER. They blood and urine tested me and of course everything came back normal and they sent me on my way. 

This week I got a complete pelvic ultrasound and had a follow up with my gyno today. I was hopeful that she would be validating and understanding of my issues. Guess I shouldn't have gotten my hopes up because after describing my symptoms to her, the first thing she said was - well your ultrasound looks normal and fatigue isn't a symptom of endo, so I'm not sure what you want us to do. I was floored. I thought she would listen to my symptoms and tell me it sounded like endo and she would recommend surgery. I feel like she just brushed me off and from what I've seen online about endo it can cause fatigue? So I'm confused. 

I feel like I basically had to diagnose myself here and am questioning if I'm doing the right thing.  I understand that it could be chronic fatigue or some autoimmune but how does that explain the ovary and back pain? It doesn't make sense. When I Google endo it says that fatigue is a symptom and I also thought that extreme pain causes fatigue anyway. Why would my doctor say this? I feel bad for people who don't argue with them and just let the doctor send them home or to a rheumatologist without further investigation. 

Another important note is I've been on the pill since I was 17 and am 23 now. My periods were always debilitating and irregular, so now I take the pill continuously to avoid the pain.

I mostly have to force myself to take shallow breaths until the painkillers kick in. God help me if I need to sneeze or cough though. 

The part that worries me isn’t the pain as much it’s the “fainting spells” it always starts with me needing the toilet (won’t get to graphic on that part) and after I finish my business I start to get dizzy sweating so much I’m literally dripping I can’t stand up I’m normally a heap on the floor begging my husband to get me some water at this point. Everything becomes cloudy and the ringing in my ear won’t stop the pain in my stomach is so unbearable that I’m saying I want to die (I’m not suicidal it’s just in the moment). The first time this happened I thought I was honestly dying telling my husband that I love him over and over. Each time this has happened I’ve managed to crawl into bed shaking or shivering and just gone to sleep. I wake up and hour or so later like it never happened.

Is this normal? 

Little background I used to have the worlds easiest periods, no pain and only lasted 3 days no heavy flow. I miss those days.

I was on the implant for 4 years but when it got replaced I turned into a monster dunno if they changed an ingredient or something. I’ve tried explaining myself to the doctors but birth control pills is all I get. I’ve tried progestin only pill, I become a depressed anger machine and I tried the combined pill, same thing I don’t think my body can handle any kind of hormones to be honest.

I’ve been suffering with this for almost 2 years now and I’m off all birth control. I think I’m starting to understand it and deal with it in my own way. Problem is I keep reading different things and I can’t really find the info I need to help me through. 

I need to know that if I do nothing then nothing bad is going to happen. I hate going to the doctors as I’m a very shy, quiet and nervous person so I never fully explain myself when face to face. Can I just let it be or will it eventually do something really bad. I know I am mentally and physically strong enough to cope with the pain and the emotional hell that goes with it. I however don’t want to leave it for it to get worse. The thought of surgery scares the hell out of me. Do the cells really bleed wherever they’re growing? Or do the just inflame? If they do bleed where does the blood go?  Could it cause other issues? I had a kidney infection after my last period and there was a little bit of blood in my poop for a couple of days.

I had to sit on the toilet for about 5 minutes until it finally stopped and obviously this was pretty scary. I was ovulating and having cramps from that and there is no way I could have been glutened in the past week that I know of. Anyways I’m wondering if this could possibly be endo related?

I originally posted this on /PCOS but it didn’t receive any feedback.  Having done some googling, I see that this drug is used more often for Endometriosis which I haven’t been diagnosed with (although at this point I wouldn’t be surprised if I were).

I had been spotting/randomly bleeding for about 6 weeks last month when my gynecologist decided to do an ultrasound.  I expected her to find something a 5-6cm cyst on either ovary (as is usually the case) when she instead told me that she couldn’t see anything because my uterine lining was too thick.

She prescribed me “Aygestin” 5mg for 30 days to help shed said lining which is supposed to make my next ultrasound more readable.  Her suspicion is that I may have a fibroid in my uterine wall which could require surgical removal.

Just curious has anybody had a similar issue?  What am I in for if I do need to have this thing removed?

Has anybody been as miserable as I am on Aygestin?  I feel like I’ve had the same gross hormonal drag &amp; dull cramps for like 3 weeks.

Is this likely just another PCOS issue rather than a fibroid?  This is a relatively new doctor for me so a piece of me remains cautious and skeptical.

I had a call with my dr today, who suggested I try tri-cycling my pill again, which is where you take the pill for three months, have a bleed, and then go back on it. I’ve tried this before, and it caused more pain, clots and a heavier period than I’ve ever had before! 

She also suggested the mini pill, a coil (I’ve tried before but it wouldn’t go in as I’m “too small”, etc) and changing my pill. Oddly enough, I like having my period because I get a lot of clots, and even though they are painful, the pain is better than when I’m not having a period. I’ve just settled into this pill, as it took a lot of time to find one which wasn’t too much testosterone and didn’t cause more pain, etc.

I’ve just settled in a good system, minus my periods being out of whack from the three month stint. I’ve changed from a cup to cloth pads, and it’s lessened my pain a little, which is great.

I felt really pressured to make a decision then and there, with all these different treatments, even telling her to not book me in for a coil again, as she was already booking dates before I’d said yes. I know she was just trying to help, and she was very lovely.

* *dark thick period blood, only get red blood once a cycle*
* *constant bloating that increases with food/liquid*
* *nausea, no appetite*
* *severe bloating, can occur randomly but is most painful and distended after eating or drinking anything*

***Tests I had done:***

* *Endoscopy '20 (clear except for minor excess acid)*
* *Colonoscopy '21 (clear except 1 polyp which was removed)*
* *Bloodwork*

Came off about 10 days ago to start trying to conceive. Had a trouble free withdrawal bleed after about 6 days. Since then I’ve had a weird thing happen that I can’t easily identify as either endo or digestive issues, and I wonder if anyone else has had this kind of pain.

So I bloat occasionally with an endo belly, I get kind of gassy and I put it down to a combination of endo inflammation and poor digestive health from my IBS. On Sunday I was gassy, like unusually and memorably so! By Monday it was so bad that I couldn’t button my pants up, and couldn’t actually differentiate anymore between typical bad lower abdominal trapped gas pains and endo/uterus pain. Everything is so squished together down there that I sometimes find it difficult to know what’s what. The gassiness is kind of going now, finally, on Wednesday, but I am left with this weird pain that I can’t explain. It’s very similar to the kind of bruised, tender pain you feel internally in your guts right after you’ve had food poisoning, as if my intestines are literally hurting right around my uterus area, but I haven’t had anything terribly traumatic happen to them to make this pain appear! Is it possible that a bad case of trapped gas can make your intestines literally hurt when you have endo? Nothing in my abdomen hurts when I palpate the area, and I am having bowel movements so no obstruction, but twisting or using my abdominal muscles really fucking hurts.

I’ve only had this kind of pain once before, which was about 18 months ago and it seemed like every time I had a bowel movement I’d get this same bruised, inflammation type pain in my lower abdomen (like right across from hip bone to hip bone) which would last a few hours. It went away after a few weeks.

About a year after that a second tumor developed on my right ovary. Surgery again but luckily just the tumor was removed and I got to keep my ovary. 

I have to get yearly checkups to just make sure it doesn't come back that includes an ultrasound. My most recent ultrasound they saw a ""focus"" and had me go get an MRI. I was worried my tumor was back. Instead they call me with the results and tell me I have deep infiltrating endometriosis and a uterine fibroid and referred me to a gyno for a consultation. No other info.

I've been doing a deep dive tonight on endometriosis, and from what I knew before too, it is SO painful for women. The thing is, I don't have a lot of pain. I sometimes have random abdominal discomfort or it hurts to push on my abdomen. I do not get cramps (and never have my whole life), and have no pain during intercourse. The only odd thing is I have had chronic UTI's, and sometimes I feel like I for sure have one, but my pee tests come back negative. I've learned to distinguish between a false alarm and a real one now. 

I guess I just feel confused and am looking for experiences or advice on what to expect at my consultation. They couldn't get me in soon, and I have to wait over a month.

Endo_iy2zrg_post,"I have suspected endo, a uterine polyp, and a 5-6cm ovarian cyst (not an endometrioma, but I’m not sure what kind of cyst, confirmed today via transvaginal ultrasound). 

I’ve had pain in my right ovary for six years now, about as long as how long I’ve had endo pain. Had a few ultrasounds, one time years back I had a “possible” 3cm cyst that my then-doctor dismissed. Last ultrasound (2 or 3 months ago) showed a “healthy ovary” and no cyst. 

I believe the cyst comes and goes. My new gyno surgeon believes this as well. 

I started my first birth control (Blisovi 1/20) almost three months ago now. In late August my ovarian cyst swelled so much that it very obviously showed through my abdomen. Based off of pics my gyno estimated it to be 8cm. It was incredibly painful. Now it’s swollen again enough to see on my abdomen. 

My first question is could the birth control have caused this increase in size? I have never before had it large enough to see when I look at my belly. My pain has increased as well, although the first month and a half it wasn’t as painful as usual. 

My second question is how potentially dangerous is having a cyst of this size? I work in a remote field camp for 6 months out of the year and can only contact a dr via email or text—no visits/imaging/etc. 

Gyno said I can have it drained with a needle before I leave. I’m leaving early october. She also wants to change my bc to nuvaring... anyone had non-endometrioma cysts who’ve taken nuvaring who could share their experience?",management,,,TRUE

Endo_7kjikd_post,"Long time lurker, first time poster.

I am 27 years old. I had a laparoscopy at the age of 24 to diagnose suspected endometriosis. My surgeon found implants on the back of my uterus, in the cup de sac and (in my surgeons words) my right broad ligament was eaten away. He preformed cauterization on the implants (urg, I didn't know at the time that this is not the best way to take care of the implants). 

My main query is based on an experience I had a year ago. I got pregnant in late October 2016. In early November (I was unaware of the pregnancy until mid December) I went to the ER with extreme bowel pain. It felt like I had steel wool scraping against my intestines. The ER doc assumed I was after pain meds, he refused to do any tests and said I didn't look like I was in any pain (FYI I have other chronic illnesses that cause me to be in pain 24/7, for me to go to the ER I had to be in a lot of pain), so I was sent home. I was given no explanation for the pain and the next day I tried eating...it didn't go well. For about 2 weeks I struggled to find something I could eat without having issues. I ended up with violent cramps, nausea and explosive diarrhea whenever I ate fresh veggies, anything dairy, bread, etc. I could have chicken broth and pea soup (only peas, no ham) without much pain. For 2 weeks that's all I ate. Then, I tried potatoes and it went OK. 

I visited my gp immediately after the ER visit and he couldn't find anything wrong, so he sent me to general surgery who scheduled me for a colonoscopy/endoscopy for mid December. My gp warned me that I might have Chrons or something...then on the day I went to do the colonoscopy I found out I was pregnant. (The pregnancy was a full molar pregnancy, I had a d&amp;c on the 28th of December )

Now, my husband and I are allowed to start TTC and so here is my question:  given the previous experience I had with pregnancy, could the pain and food intolerance have been caused by the pregnancy because of endometrial implants, adhesions and an expanding uterus? Has anyone experienced anything similar?

endometriosis_oa06d8_post,"Hello everyone,

I have been diagnosed through an MRI that I have an endo nodule in the recto-vaginal septum (RVE). The doc I'm consulting is an endo specialist. And from the MRI, he thinks the nodule is not into the rectum, so he can shave it off but that the dissection can get close to the nerves nearby so he has to be careful. The nodule is also growing laterally i.e. into utero ligament apparently, so he suggests to handle it now before it progresses further. He told me if all goes well, he expects me to be discharged next day itself and that he wouldn't consider this high risk. At the same time he also said this - ""In all likelihood it won't effect the rectum but even if the procedure endsup doing a small hole in the rectum, I can repair it"".

That last part is what I'm afraid of - the possible complication and it's effect on my quality of life. As of today I have minimal symptoms. I only get ""butt pain"" pain during periods and some mild symptoms right after the period. I've been on birth control for years, so I don't see much symptoms beyond that. But I'm 34f and we have been trying to conceive for a couple of years now. I didn't try an ivf yet - it's affordable for us, but doc suggests to get endo fixed first and that I may actually conceive naturally after excision surgery.

Do you all think I'm over worried about the potential complications? My worry is that right now I don't have symptoms, and hope that an IVF could potentially help us to conceive. But on the other hand, I'm leaving endo untreated and it could progress beyond and importantly the ivf success rate itself could be diminished due to endo.

Endo_k5k6t4_post,"Online they mention information regarding the role heightened estrogen plays in endometriosis. I recently told somebody, who went to nursing school, that I developed symptoms as a teenager (regardless of whether or not I actually have the medical condition).  


If you want me to be further specific regarding my symptoms, I've experienced menstrual periods where I would feel as if my uterus is being stabbed with multiple knives. The pain would oftentimes induce symptoms, such as vomiting, cold (or hot) flashes, diarrhea, feeling as if my intestinal track in ripping apart, feeling like a zombie, etc.   
It could even be described as mine sweepers going off in my uterus.  


At times the pain would get so severe that I could barely even get up, walk or say anything. Many women cry during their periods, but with me, it would get so bad that it leaves me speechless. Whenever I experience this, I can't even cry because the pain distracts me from doing so.  


I was informed that if I have it, it's probably because my body produces high levels of testosterone. In general, I actually do have a bit more testosterone in me than I probably should, so her exclamation made sense to me.  
After mentioning the decline of my symptoms as I got older, she told me that it's because my body starts to produce more estrogen during my mid-20s (for the record, I'm currently 24), therefore my symptoms would start to lessen a little.  
Most articles mention a link between estrogen and the condition, as opposed to testosterone and the condition. I've read one piece of information on google stating that women who have PCOS or high testosterone for any reason, are at risk for developing it as well.  
So I'm assuming that this girl giving me information may not be entirely wrong about my T levels contributing to the symptoms. If both are technically true, can you please explain the science behind all of this? I would highly appreciate it!

endometriosis_i08jss_post,"I'll try to make a (very) long story as short as possible.  I'm 40 years old, and I have been dealing with pelvic pain for years.  Over the last several months, it has become much worse and harder to live with.  I spend many days every month in moderate to severe pain, and nothing helps much, although caffeine seems to intensify it.  

In 2017, I was having so much spotting that I was concerned I had a serious issue.  The doctor found multiple polyps and growths (something between a polyp and fibroid, they said), which were removed.  They wanted to do exploratory surgery for endometriosis, but at the time, I couldn't afford the laparoscopy.  They gave me an IUD to help slow the uterine growths, but after six months, I had it removed.  My periods became so long, and I felt so bloated, that I couldn't take it anymore.  But I had no pain.

In January of 2019, I got a huge surprise and became pregnant.  Sadly, I lost the pregnancy at ten weeks.  This is around the time that everything seemed to get worse.  By December of last year, I was having daily stabbing pains, but the pains that I have are always worst for me around ovulation.  A day or two before my cycle app predicts ovulation, I start having all the symptoms.  This month, the symptoms started early, and I worry it's just all getting worse.  This is what I experience:

Pelvic and lower abdominal pain (stabbing, burning, stinging, aching)

Painful sex and pain after orgasm

Back, leg, and joint pain

Upset stomach and constipation

Bowel movement pain

Frequent nausea

Bloating and gas

Spotting on and off all month, especially around ovulation

Fatigue and malaise

I went back to my doctor this past January.  They did another ultrasound with pain-mapping.  They found that I had a new polyp growing and a new fibroid and ""slightly thickened"" endometrium, but said they could see no signs of endometriosis on ultrasound (which I thought was typical).  The doctor said she would advise me to see a gastroenterologist and a urologist because the pain was likely not reproductive, even though I have noticed a clear monthly pattern to it.  She said she would be willing to try an estrogen birth control pill to see if it managed the pain, but otherwise would recommend I seek help from my family doctor.  When I told her I'd already had a colonoscopy in the last year and that everything was normal, she said I should go back to make sure it's not a bowel issue causing my pain.  She also said that endometriosis does not get worse with ovulation, only with menstruation.  Is this always the case, though?

I am CONVINCED I have endometriosis at this point, based on the type and amount of pain I'm currently experiencing, and I'm curious if her suggestion for treatment is normal.  An estrogen-based pill?

But as they are open again, I need to go back with a plan of action.  The pain is causing me so much anxiety that it's ruining my life.

My right tube was found to be clear last year as was the inside of my uterus last month. I saw a RE for a time where it was determined I do not have PCOS.

In November 2015 I had extreme pain on my left side, presumably my ovarian area on the second day of my period. My husband took me to the ER and the staff proceeded to treat me like a crazy woman who must've been imagining the pain -or just wanted drugs. About 3-4 hours after the pain started, it went away just as fast; then, I really DID feel like a crazy person. Convinced my pain was gut related, my primary care physician had me get an abdominal scan, which came back clear. 

The next month on the second day of my cycle, I started feeling the same pain and went straight to my PCP, and she realized it was ovarian in nature. Fortunately, the pain only lasted a half hour and didn't get anywhere near as bad as the first time. 

Since then, I hadn't had that same crazy pain as Nov 2015. I've noticed my second cycle day is pretty crampy to the point even ibuprofen can't do much, but that has been all, until two nights ago. 

My husband and I were out of town and I got the same panting, curl up in a ball, agonizing pain as 2015 on my same left side.

Once again, after 3-4 hours, I finally had some relief and was able to go to sleep for the night. I've felt normal since then.

Does anyone have any idea what may be causing this pain? I suppose it may be an ovarian cyst rupture, but I thought those were more active mid-cycle. Can endometriomas cause this pain?

Will I be able to go to the toilet by myself? (if there isn't a colostomy bag involved offcourse) am I able to shower myself? How will anesthesia make me feel? What should I eat or drink? What kind of pain meds should I arrange?

I was told I will receive a morfine pump in hospital. I told my doctor I rather go without any painmeds. He chuckled and said I will prob really need it. But do I really need it? Or is there anyone who went trough post op without any painmeds?

I just want to make my recovery smooth as possible. I'm already out of shape because of other chronic illnesses I have. So I'm pretty worried.

What kind of supplements should I get?",management,,,FALSE

Endo_mfi3pn_post,"My periods are awful. When I turned 20, I started vomiting from the pain. I would take a Benadryl just to sleep through it. A few years later I tried going gluten free. It did wonders. I could take a Motrin and go about my day. I had brought up endo with my doctors but they said the only way to dx was with surgery.. which creates scar tissue. Why bother, right? Well now that I’ve had a miscarriage I want to look into this more. Is there any other way to get diagnosed? What are the treatments? I feel like crap on BC.",diagnosis,management,,FALSE
Endo_mvn9ly_post,Every once and a while I get cyst like swelling (hard to the touch and painful) in my upper labia but they usually go away. I started my period yesterday and noticed a heavy pressure down there and just ignored it because it always happens the first day of my period. I was wearing a thong yesterday and walking around a lot if that makes a difference. Anyways I ended up getting a soreness and today noticed the hard cyst like thing came back but only on one side (right). There has been a little burning but not really any at all. I was wondering if I just get Bartholyns cysts a lot and if it’s hormonal or related to endo?,manifestation,,,FALSE

Endo_fjc72i_post,"So I just had my diagnostic surgery this past Wednesday, and apparently my doctor had to remove a lot of endo from the right side. I have 4 incisions, the lower left &amp; right, through the belly button and one about belly button height but a bit to the left. Anyway, I just got my period today, and I've been feeling a bit better with recovery, but now that I have my period its really hurting on my lower left side. I did a bit more than I usually have been, trying to push myself the healthy amount. But I did notice some increased pain on the lower right incision too. Is any of this normal to have when you get your period right after surgery?",management,,,TRUE
endometriosis_iok4az_post,"Hi everyone! New to the sub I’m coming here for input because I missed my post op on accident (I’ve been kicking myself all month, I know) and my OBGYN moved cross country three days after the appointment so I couldn’t reschedule with her. I can’t get in with a new OBGYN until October 21st!!!! (My laparoscopy was July 9th). So, basically everything was going smoothly up until about a month ago. They removed the endo, put in a barrier, stitched me up and sent me on my way. I had a period a week after the surgery, and it was normal and not too painful. I inserted a new Nuvaring after my period and thought everything was good. It’s worth mentioning the symptoms I’m about go into do not happen when I’m using my NuvaRing property, which I have been. Fast forward about a week, I start getting shooting pains on the side where the barrier is (not debilitating but enough to concern me) and sharp, abnormal cramping in general. I brushed it off, but it persisted through the month, then I inserted another ring (I do three continuous, then a period) it’s been about a week since changing the ring and the cramping is more frequent and I’m having really abnormal brown and white discharge, that was not happening last month. I’m concerned as things seem to be getting worse with time TLDR; is persistent cramping and abnormal discharge normal this long after a laparoscopy? Should I be concerned at the worsening symptoms? Should I try to be seen by an OBGYN sooner?? I would really super appreciate any input!!! Love y’all stay strong ❤️",management,,,TRUE
endometriosis_965x9r_post,"I'm currently waiting for surgery for an endometrioma. I've noticed recently that I have no sensation of needing to have a bowel movement. The only sign I get is increased pain. I've learnt to listen to it now, and go to the bathroom. I'm able to go fairly easily when I do, not constipated. Although occasionally there is some diarrhea. But no sensation of needing to go. Is this a known sign of endometriosis on the bowel? I have no problem with peeing. ",manifestation,diagnosis,,FALSE
