N1,"My friend's mom needs a liver One of my best friend's mom is uninsured and has been diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver. She's a sweet lady who doesn't drink or do drugs or anything like that. She's just a simple mother, wife, and homemaker.

She's not expected to make it through the end of the year if she doesn't get a transplant, but being uninsured is a big obstacle.

Does anybody have any information on a situation like this? Are there any organizations, charities, medical groups, or other institutions out there that can help work around the insurance issue? Or any insurance companies willing to take on a patient in immediate need of a liver transplant?

I realize these questions might be kind of dumb, but I have absolutely zero experience with anything like this, and I want to help gather information for my friend. Any leads, info, and/or resources would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.",y2c05a,is22jkd,"Its not just a work around the insurance, she will need lifelong expensive meds after surgery as well. Why does she not have insurance?","I'm sorry to hear about your friend's mom. It can be very difficult to navigate the healthcare system, especially when dealing with a serious medical condition like cirrhosis of the liver. Here are a few options to consider that may be able to help your friend's mom get the treatment she needs:
Transplant centers: Many transplant centers have financial assistance programs that can help cover the cost of a transplant for uninsured or underinsured patients. These programs may be able to help your friend's mom get the transplant she needs, even if she does not have insurance.
Medicare: If your friend's mom is over the age of 65, she may be eligible for Medicare, which is a federal health insurance program for seniors. Medicare can help cover the cost of a liver transplant, as well as other medical expenses.
Medicaid: If your friend's mom has a low income, she may be eligible for Medicaid, which is a government-run health insurance program for low-income individuals and families. Medicaid can help cover the cost of a liver transplant, as well as other medical expenses.
Charity care: Many hospitals and medical centers have charity care programs that provide free or discounted medical care to patients who are unable to pay. Your friend's mom may be able to get financial assistance through a charity care program.
Fundraising: Another option to consider is starting a fundraising campaign to help cover the cost of the transplant. There are a number of online platforms that make it easy to create and share a fundraising campaign. You could also reach out to local organizations or businesses to see if they would be willing to donate or help spread the word about your campaign.
It's important to keep in mind that getting a liver transplant is a complex process, and it may take some time to find a suitable donor and arrange for the transplant.

Should I be worried?!",y4fxjx,isdwsqd,The answer simply is no..,"It is not uncommon for people to experience muscle aches or pains in various parts of their body after sneezing. Sneezing is a sudden, forceful reflex that can cause muscle contractions throughout the body. In most cases, muscle pain or discomfort after sneezing is temporary and not a cause for concern. However, if the pain is severe or persists for a long time, it is a good idea to consult a healthcare professional for further evaluation.
There are several possible causes for muscle pain after sneezing, including:
Straining the muscles: Sneezing can cause muscle strain, particularly in the chest and neck. This can lead to muscle aches and pains, especially if you have a cold or are experiencing allergies.
Poor posture: If you have poor posture, sneezing can put additional strain on your muscles, leading to pain.
Other medical conditions: In some cases, muscle pain after sneezing may be a sign of an underlying medical condition, such as fibromyalgia or multiple sclerosis. If you have other symptoms in addition to muscle pain after sneezing, or if the pain is severe or persistent, it is important to speak with a healthcare professional for further evaluation.

My GP has looked inside, said it looked fine, and suggested Eustachian tube disfunction. He recommended nasal steroid sprays, which I tried to no real effect. The tinnitus can be modulated by moving my jaw, and I don't have any history of listening to loud noises or hearing loss.

It's common for people to have difficulty adjusting to a new sleep schedule, especially when it involves waking up significantly earlier than they are used to. Here are a few strategies you can try to help shift your body's internal clock and improve your sleep:

Gradually adjust your bedtime: Instead of trying to go to sleep at a specific time, try gradually shifting your bedtime earlier by 15-30 minutes each night until you reach your desired bedtime. This can help your body slowly adjust to the new schedule.

Keep a consistent sleep schedule: Try to go to bed and wake up at the same time every day, even on weekends. This can help your body get into a regular rhythm.

Create a bedtime routine: Establish a relaxing bedtime routine, such as taking a warm bath or reading a book, to help you wind down before sleep.

Avoid screens before bedtime: The blue light emitted by screens can disrupt your body's production of the sleep hormone melatonin, so try to avoid screens for at least an hour before bedtime.

Get some sunlight during the day: Exposure to sunlight during the day can help regulate your body's internal clock. Try to get outside for a few minutes during the day, especially in the morning.

Consider using a sleep aid: If you are having difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep, you may want to consider using a sleep aid such as melatonin. Talk to your healthcare provider to determine the best option for you.

There is no noted weight change over this time period. No noted diarrhea or swollen nodes. The rash the patient described the week prior had an acute abrupt onset and 5-10 minutes later would dissipate.

Rheumatology was consulted on the patient from admission. Lab studies were sent to rule-out an infectious etiology for rash. Strep culture was negative. EKG was also performed to rule-out a prolonged PR interval. EKG was within normal limits. A DNase B antibody was 547 and an ASO titer was 300. While results were elevated, the patient did no meet clinical criteria for rheumatic fever and diagnosis that was most likely entertained was systemic JIA. Further lab work included an ANA which was negative, rheumatoid factor which was negative, a CRP on admission was 8.6 mg/dL with an ESR about 80. CK and aldolase were within normal limits. Ferritin was elevated at 663. LDH was within normal limits. CBC was reassuring with normal white counts, hemoglobin and platelets; findings nonsuggestive of leukemia. Hepatic panel within normal limits. A chest x-ray was done to rule-out mediastinal mass, and that was negative. From an infectious standpoint, Parvo, CMV, EBV were all negative. Clinically the patient was noted to have a salmon-colored transient rash that would come and go throughout the hospitalization lasting a matter of minutes. No definite arthritis on examination. Oncology was consulted given the history of arthritis and fevers. It was felt in the setting of normal cell lines in evaluating a smear, which revealed no blasts, no indication of hepatomegaly or splenomegaly and uric acid and LDH within normal limits and x-ray that was normal, they felt that further oncologic evaluation was not indicated and a bone marrow was not indicated at that time. Cardiology was also officially consulted because the patient had a 2/6 ejection murmur on the exam. Cardiology felt the murmur was a flow murmur and evaluated the EKG, which they read as

Answer to your question, yes, those symptoms can be caused by diabetic peripheral neuropathy, you need your blood glucose controlled better, you can take pregabalin to control the pain that‰Ûªs due to diabetes..","It is possible that the arm pain you are experiencing could be related to your neuropathy. Neuropathy, or damage to the nerves, can cause a variety of symptoms, including pain, numbness, tingling, and weakness. The severity of these symptoms can vary from person to person, and can affect different parts of the body in different ways.

Given your description of the pain, it is possible that the nerve damage you are experiencing is causing inflammation or irritation in the affected area, which is causing the pain.

It is important to consult with a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan. They will be able to determine the cause of your arm pain and recommend appropriate treatment options. It may be necessary to adjust your medications or insulin pump dosage, or to try other treatment options such as physical therapy or nerve block injections.

Edit: This website has info about public dental services if you are based in NSW:

https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/oralhealth/Pages/info-patients.aspx#appointments","I'm sorry to hear about the difficult circumstances you grew up in and the challenges you are facing with your dental health. It's understandable that you may feel anxious about going to the dentist, but seeking dental care is important for maintaining good oral health and overall well-being.
In Australia, there are a few options available for low-cost or no-cost dental care, depending on your circumstances. Here are some suggestions:
1.	Medicare: If you have a Medicare card, you may be eligible for the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) General Dental Scheme, which covers some dental services for children and adults with a disability, medical condition, or certain other circumstances. You can check your eligibility and find out more about the MBS General Dental Scheme by visiting the Medicare website or speaking with a Medicare representative.
2.	Public dental clinics: Many states and territories in Australia operate public dental clinics that provide low-cost or no-cost dental care to eligible individuals, such as those with low incomes, children, and seniors. You can contact your local public dental clinic to find out if you are eligible and to make an appointment.
3.	Private dental care with payment plans: If you are not eligible for the MBS General Dental Scheme or public dental clinics, you may be able to seek dental care at a private practice. Some private practices offer payment plans or financing options to help make treatment more affordable. You can ask about these options when you make an appointment.
When you go to the dentist, you will generally be asked to fill out a medical history form and then be seen by the dentist for an examination. The dentist will assess your oral health and discuss any treatment recommendations with you. You can ask about the cost of treatment and payment options before proceeding with any treatment. It's also a good idea to discuss any concerns or questions you have with the dentist.
I hope this information is helpful. If you have any further questions or need additional support, please don't hesitate to ask.

It's important to seek medical attention as soon as possible if you experience any of the following symptoms after a head injury:
‰Û¢	Loss of consciousness, even if it's just for a few seconds
‰Û¢	Severe or worsening headache
‰Û¢	Nausea or vomiting
‰Û¢	Slurred speech
‰Û¢	Difficulty with balance or coordination
‰Û¢	Seizures
‰Û¢	Changes in behavior or personality
‰Û¢	Clear fluid draining from the nose or ears
It's also a good idea to see a doctor if you experience neck pain after a head injury, as this could be a sign of a neck injury.
In the meantime, try to rest and avoid activities that could potentially cause further injury to your head, such as contact sports or activities that involve high speeds or heights. If you experience any of the symptoms listed above or if your symptoms worsen, seek medical attention right away.

While it's always best to consult a medical professional in person for a definitive answer, it's possible that you may benefit from getting an X-ray to determine if there is any underlying damage to your hand.
In general, X-rays are useful for identifying fractures, dislocations, and other injuries to bones. If you have any swelling, bruising, or difficulty moving your hand, it's worth considering getting an X-ray to check for any possible fractures or dislocations.
If you're experiencing significant pain or difficulty using your hand, it's important to see a medical professional as soon as possible. Even if the pain subsides, it's still important to get a proper evaluation to ensure that there is no underlying injury that needs to be addressed.
I would recommend contacting a healthcare professional, such as a primary care doctor or an urgent care clinic, to discuss your concerns and determine if an X-ray is necessary. They can provide you with more specific recommendations based on your individual situation.

N16,"How bad is this PET Scan result? Testicular cancer patient. Explanation of scan would be helpful. 27M - 6‰Ûª7‰Û�, 225lbs. White. Generally healthy before cancer. Bad at Reddit format. 


Diagnosed with stage 3 seminoma in July of this year. Had surgery and did four rounds of etoposide and cisplatin as chemotherapy. Seminoma did not present physically, only presentation was severe back pain. I have had other back issues so I lived in pain for close to a year. Went to oncologist per ER referral and Ultrasound confirmed seminoma. 


I got a pet scan today after completing chemo last week. I was very optimistic and my doctor has given me no reason to suspect there would be any problems. He said 95% sure chemo would take care of it. I am going to paste the results that were posted on my patient portal below. I am a big boy and a logical thinker please Don‰Ûªt sugar coat theses results, translate and explain if possible. I was expecting good news but I can tell this is not. I can have peace if I understand it. My follow up with my oncologist is not until next week and I‰Ûªm very anxious and want to understand. 

Begin Results:‰ÛÓ‰ÛÓ‰ÛÓ‰ÛÓ-:

Impression:
1.Hypermetabolic left hilar lymph node unchanged in size from prior exam. Calcification present. Metastatic disease cannot be excluded as this node was not hypermetabolic on prior exam. 2. Much improvement in retroperitoneal adenopathy in both size of lymph nodes, extent of lymph nodes, and decrease in hypermetabolic activity compared to prior exam. 3. No other areas of metastatic disease suspected.



Findings:
1. There is a calcified left hilar lymph node unchanged in size from prior exam probably about 1 cm in short axis measurements with a maximum SUV today of 5.3 and previously not hypermetabolic maximum activity 2.0.



2.  The previously noted large intra-aortocaval lymph node has markedly decreased in size and on today's exam is subcentimeter in short axis measurements with a maximum SUV of 6.8 whereas previously maximum SUV was 16.6.



3.  More inferiorly in the intra-aortocaval region of the retroperitoneum where multiple previous adjacent hypermetabolic lymph nodes were seen with a maximum SUV of 20.8, on today's exam 1 lymph node measuring roughly 8 mm in short axis measurement is present maximum SUV 6.8.",yedcir,ity1bl6,"A PET scan obtained right after finishing chemotherapy increases the likelihood of false positive results. It takes time for your body to clean up after chemotherapy or surgery or radiation. The residual activity that a PET scan captures in the active areas can take a few months to calm down. The presence of hypermetabolic areas is not unexpected when it was only a week since your last treatment. 

The fact that the areas of activity noted on prior scans are now smaller is good news. It strongly suggests that your cancer is responding to treatment. The new spot in your chest (the hilar node) may or may not be significant. There are other things that can cause a node to light up on PET scan. The presence of calcifications in a node is usually an indication of benign causes, rather than malignant causes of hypermetabolic activity. The only way to know for sure is a biopsy, which they probably won't recommend right now. 

Note: I am not an oncologist. Talk to your doctor about the results and the plan for follow-up. 
Good luck!","It appears that the PET scan has shown some changes in certain lymph nodes in your body. Lymph nodes are small, bean-shaped structures found throughout your body that help to filter out harmful substances and fight infection. In the context of cancer, lymph nodes can sometimes become involved in the spread of cancer cells from the original tumor site to other parts of the body.
The first finding mentioned in the results is a calcified left hilar lymph node that is unchanged in size from a previous exam. This means that there is a small, hard mass of tissue in the left hilar region (an area near the center of your chest) that has not changed in size since it was last seen. The calcification suggests that the tissue has undergone some sort of hardening process. The fact that this lymph node was not previously hypermetabolic (meaning it did not show high levels of metabolic activity on a previous scan) but now has a maximum SUV (standardized uptake value, which is a measure of how much radioactivity is taken up by the tissue) of 5.3 suggests that there may be something going on with this lymph node that was not present before, and that further evaluation is needed to determine whether this is a metastasis (spread) of cancer cells.
The second finding mentioned in the results is an improvement in the size, extent, and hypermetabolic activity of retroperitoneal adenopathy (enlargement of lymph nodes in the retroperitoneum, which is the area behind the abdominal cavity). This is generally considered a positive finding, as it suggests that the chemotherapy you received may have been effective in reducing the size and activity of these lymph nodes.
The third finding mentioned in the results is the absence of any other suspected areas of metastatic disease. This means that, aside from the left hilar lymph node mentioned above, there are no other areas in your body that appear to be involved with the spread of cancer cells.
It's important to note that PET scans can be highly sensitive tests, and can sometimes pick up small changes that may not necessarily be clinically significant. It's also important to keep in mind that the results of a single scan should not be taken in isolation, but rather should be considered in the context of all of your medical history and the results of other tests and exams. It's best to discuss the results of your PET scan with your oncologist, who will be able to provide more information and context based on your specific case. I hope this helps to provide some clarity on the results of your scan.

It's understandable that you are worried and want to find out what is causing the pain.
There are several other potential causes of testicular pain that can be considered. Some other possible causes of testicular pain include:
‰Û¢	Infection: An infection in the testicles or surrounding area can cause pain. This could be a sexually transmitted infection (STI) or a non-sexually transmitted infection.
‰Û¢	Trauma or injury: If you have experienced any recent trauma or injury to the testicles or surrounding area, this could be causing your pain.
‰Û¢	Hernia: As you mentioned, a hernia could potentially cause testicular pain. A hernia occurs when a part of the intestine or other tissue protrudes through a weak point in the abdominal muscles.
‰Û¢	Muscular issues: Pain in the testicles can also be caused by muscle strain or other muscle-related issues in the area.
It's important to note that the cause of testicular pain can be difficult to determine without a thorough examination and possibly additional testing. It would be best to follow up with a healthcare provider to determine the cause of your pain and to discuss treatment options. They will be able to examine you, ask you questions about your symptoms, and possibly order additional testing to help determine the cause of your pain.
In the meantime, try to avoid any activities that might exacerbate your pain, and use pain medication as directed by a healthcare provider if you have been prescribed any. It's also important to stay hydrated and try to get enough rest.
I hope this information is helpful, and I hope you are able to find relief from your pain soon. If you have any additional questions or concerns, don't hesitate to ask.

I later took 600mg ibuprofen, also no improvement. I was putting in an earring (which I‰Ûªve never had a problem with shots, piercings, excision biopsies, etc and i was not nervous or had locked knees or w/e) and after putting it in I immediately got dizzy with tunnel vision.

This is where I know it wasn‰Ûªt fainting: He said my body stiffened and I was still standing while unconscious, I let out a groan, and then mainly my upper body began convulsing. He laid me down in the hallway and the convulsions calmed down. He said at that point my face was turning blue and he thought I needed CPR, so he began compressions.

Given your symptoms and the fact that your D-dimer levels are still elevated, it may be a good idea to follow up with your healthcare provider for further evaluation and testing. Your provider may recommend additional blood work or imaging studies to help determine the cause of your elevated D-dimer levels and to evaluate for the presence of a blood clot. They may also consider your medical history and any other relevant factors when determining the best course of treatment.
I hope this information is helpful. Please don't hesitate to reach out to your healthcare provider if you have any further questions or concerns.

N30,"I have blisters on my hand that come and go, itchy to the touch https://i.imgur.com/KKKnOF8.jpg

25M from Germany, no known health issues except a strong cold from about 2-3 weeks ago. 174cm, 70kg. Took Paracetamol and Ibuprofen during the cold, now on nothing.

These blisters form sporadically on my right hand and are tingling/itchy to the touch. No pain or anything. I have no idea where they could be coming from. I‰Ûªve noticed a couple of itchy spots on my body the last two weeks which I though would be from mosquitoes but I don‰Ûªt think that‰Ûªs it. Most spots are just itching with no visible bite marks or blisters of any kind, but I don‰Ûªt have 2 or 3 tiny little blister on other parts of my body. Not really painful though, just kinda annoying and very small. The spot on my right hand has me worried though, I don‰Ûªt want it to break out even more. Any ideas that it could be? 

Thank you",yfn3f0,iu5tfnt,"It looks like pompholyx to me which is a kind of eczema and these fluid filled blisters are usually triggered by certain chemicals in soaps , perfumes , detergents , cosmetics and even by stress ( though the exact cause of this condition is unknown).

Usually steroid creams and emollients are first line of treatment and some people also find relief I'm soaking their hand in potassium permanganate solution. You do need a consult with a dermatologist for a proper prescription.

You can read more about pompholyx here 

https://eczema.org/information-and-advice/types-of-eczema/pompholyx-eczema-2/","It's difficult to determine the cause of your blisters without more information or a physical examination. However, some possible causes of blisters on the hand that come and go and are itchy to the touch include:

Allergic reactions: Allergic reactions can sometimes cause blisters on the skin. If you have recently started using a new product (such as a lotion or detergent) or have been exposed to an allergen, this could be the cause.

Infections: Certain infections, such as herpes simplex virus or chickenpox, can cause blisters on the skin.

Autoimmune disorders: Autoimmune disorders, such as pemphigus vulgaris or bullous pemphigoid, can cause blisters on the skin.

Physical trauma: Blisters can also be caused by physical trauma, such as friction or burns.

It's important to see a healthcare provider for a proper diagnosis and treatment. They will be able to determine the cause of your blisters and recommend the appropriate treatment. In the meantime, it's important to avoid popping the blisters, as this can increase your risk of infection. If the blisters are causing discomfort, you can use over-the-counter creams or ointments to help soothe the skin.",ChatGPT,Physician,Physician,4,4,4,4,4,5,1,4,2,1,4,4,87,164
N31,"My mom [53F] has stage 4 breast cancer and is adamant on using dangerous substances to 'treat' herself Hello,

My mom was recently diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer. Thankfully she has started treatment with oral medicine and will start Xgeva injections at her next visit, but she still says that she does not trust the doctors fully. During our first visit to the doctor she told him that she wanted to treat her cancer in a more ""natural way"". 

Earlier today she asked me for my paypal password, which i had no problem with. I didn't really question it, but I then got emailed receipts from purchases that she had made. She used my account to buy Black Slave and Sodium Chorite (which she will use to make MMS or a ""Miracle Mineral Supplement""). The doctor had told us that her cancer was quite close to the skin and I am aware that she may have a skin lesion there, and i know she will be using Black Salve to 'cure' the skin lesion. I also searched up the ""miracle"" mineral supplement, and it is something that conspiracy theorists promote as an end all be all cure to seemingly every illness ranging from cancer and HIV to COVID-19 and the common flu. I have just contacted paypal to cancel the payments and I hope she never gets a hold of them.

I have tried telling her and showing her images of how harmful these substances are to the human body but she doesn't believe me and just brushes me off and i don't know what to do.. Just now when i tried talking to her about why using these would be a bad idea, i noticed that she was reading something about MMS on her computer. I fear that as time goes by she will become more and more convinced of these alternate techniques, which could end badly. 

How can i convince her to stop believing these things? What can i do?",yah3cm,itbfv3f,"There's probably nothing you can do, no magic combination of words you can use to convince her. 

Getting diagnosed with Stage IV cancer is a massive psychological trauma, it breaks a lot of people. Right now she is probably in a storm of emotions, and will latch onto any hope that is offered. I imagine her doctors aren't giving her very positive and hopeful outlooks and are probably telling her that there's no treatment that they can offer to save her life. Alternatively, there are stories on the internet filled with hope about MMS and other naturopathic/homeopathic remedies.

People who have just been broken by a diagnosis like this often aren't using logic to make decisions, they use emotions. If you want to use a 5 Stages of Grief Model to help you understand what's going on, she's in the bargaining stage. She sees the hope and positivity on the internet and latches onto it because of course she will.

There's likely nothing you can do to change her thinking, she's not using logic to make these decisions, so logic is not going to make her stop. She just has to work through her grief until she comes to acceptance. You can try to fight it if you want, but you're not going to win. I'd suggest trying to minimize conflict and support her through this time as best you can, even though she's making emotional decisions. Do you want to remember this time as filled with fighting?","I'm so sorry to hear about your mom's cancer diagnosis and the added stress of her interest in potentially harmful alternative treatments. It can be difficult to convince someone to stop believing in something that they have come to hold as truth, especially when it comes to matters of health.
It's understandable that you want to help your mom and do what you can to support her, but it's important to remember that you cannot force her to do anything. However, there are some things you can try to help her understand the dangers of the substances she is considering using:
1.	Encourage her to speak with her medical team: It's important that she has the opportunity to ask her doctors and other medical professionals any questions or concerns she may have about her treatment plan. They can provide reliable information and address any myths or misinformation she may have come across.
2.	Offer to help her find reputable sources of information: There is a lot of false or misleading information available online, and it can be overwhelming to try to sort through it all. Offer to help your mom find reliable sources of information, such as reputable cancer organizations or peer-reviewed medical journals.
3.	Show her the evidence: If your mom is open to hearing more about the dangers of the substances she is considering using, try to provide her with evidence from credible sources. For example, you can show her research studies or articles from reputable medical organizations that demonstrate the risks of using these substances.
4.	Emphasize the importance of following her treatment plan: It's important for your mom to understand that her treatment plan has been carefully developed by her medical team to give her the best chance of a positive outcome. Emphasize the importance of following the treatment plan as recommended by her doctors.
5.	Seek support for yourself: Caring for a loved one with cancer can be emotionally and physically draining. Make sure to take care of yourself and seek support from friends, family, or a mental health professional if you need it.
I hope these suggestions are helpful. Please know that you are not alone in this situation and that there are resources available to support you and your mom.

N33,"I'm (18M) clueless, surrounded by anti-vaxxers and I need help and information about vaccines Hello. This has nothing to do with politics. I'm worried about my health and need help.

I am not vaccinated against Covid-19, and I do not remember ever getting any vaccine as a child.
My mother told me she had me get all the mandatory vaccines as a baby/young child.

My whole family is strongly against vaccines, and not a single one of them is vaccinated against Covid. Since 2020 I've been bombarded with conflicting information and my brain is basically mush on the topic. I'm absolutely clueless.

I've gotten sick a couple times over the past 2 years, and I've done many covid tests, but they were always negative. I've never caught the virus, nor has my mother.

A few members of my family have gotten it, and my grandpa died from it; he was already in very bad health conditions due to old age, but everyone else is fine and have always been healthy.

Every person I know who has gotten it was fine after a few days, and the symptoms were mild.

Every time I hear my family talk, I hear conspiracy theorists spitting fluff, but at the same time every personal experience I've had tells me that it's not that bad.

I know that the data is out there. I know science is right, I'm not against masks, and I'm not against the vaccine. I've been raised in a sub-optimal environment and it's hard to detach from it.

Before, during and after the lockdowns I was (and still somewhat am) severely depressed and non caring about my health. This has and is affecting my ability to think rationally.

I've been over 18 for a few months now, but I haven't yet decided to get the shot. It seems like a hassle that isn't worth it, especially considering that I have no clue where to get the vaccine, if I should get all of the other ones that my mother hasn't given me and a bunch of other stuff.

My depression prevents me for doing anything that takes a bit of effort so I'm asking you to please convince me that I need to get the vaccine.

I'm in Italy, and I haven't heard about covid cases and vaccines in many months now. Just writing this post put a weight on my heart. I ask you to please not judge me as you would a typical politics-based antivaxxer. I'm just confused",y16459,iry4lxa,See your general practitioner. They‰Ûªll understand and will sort you out bro.,"I understand that you may be feeling overwhelmed and confused about vaccines, especially with all the conflicting information and strong anti-vaccine views in your family. It's important to remember that vaccines are a proven and effective way to protect ourselves and others from serious and potentially life-threatening diseases.
First of all, it's important to know that vaccines are safe and effective. Vaccines undergo rigorous testing and evaluation before they are approved for use, and they are continuously monitored for safety once they are in use. The vast majority of people who receive vaccines experience no serious side effects, and any side effects that do occur are usually mild and go away quickly on their own.
Vaccines work by helping the body develop immunity to a particular disease. When you get a vaccine, your body produces an immune response to the vaccine, which helps it to recognize and fight off the disease if you are exposed to it in the future. This means that if you get vaccinated, you are less likely to get sick from a particular disease and, if you do get sick, your symptoms will likely be milder.
It's also important to consider the impact of vaccines on the wider community. When more people in a community are vaccinated, it creates herd immunity, which helps to protect those who are unable to receive certain vaccines due to age, underlying health conditions, or other factors. This is especially important for protecting vulnerable populations, such as young children, elderly people, and those with compromised immune systems.
Given the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, it is especially important to consider getting vaccinated against the virus. While it is true that some people who contract COVID-19 have mild symptoms or no symptoms at all, the virus can be severe and even deadly for others, especially those who are older or have underlying health conditions. Getting vaccinated not only helps to protect you from getting sick, but it also helps to slow the spread of the virus and bring the pandemic under control.
I understand that it can be difficult to make decisions about your health when you are feeling depressed, but I encourage you to consider seeking help for your depression and to take steps to take care of yourself. This might include seeking support from a mental health professional, talking to a trusted friend or family member, or finding healthy ways to manage your stress and emotions.
In terms of getting vaccinated, it's important to remember that you are an adult now and have the right to make decisions about your own health. You can talk to a healthcare provider or visit a vaccination center to learn more about the vaccines that are available to you and to get the information and support you need to make an informed decision.

It could be dietary if she‰Ûªs not eating well or taking medication on an empty stomach.

It's understandable that you and your sister are concerned about her stomach pain. While I can't diagnose your niece's condition or provide specific medical advice, I can provide some general information about stomach pain in children.
It's not uncommon for children to experience stomach pain from time to time, and the cause can vary. In some cases, stomach pain can be related to an infection or illness, such as a cold or the flu. It could also be caused by indigestion, constipation, or other digestive issues. In rare cases, stomach pain could be a sign of a more serious condition, such as appendicitis or inflammatory bowel disease.
If your niece's stomach pain persists or becomes severe, it may be a good idea for your sister to seek further medical attention. It's also important to watch for other symptoms that may indicate a more serious problem, such as severe abdominal swelling, vomiting, fever, or difficulty passing stool.
In the meantime, it might be helpful for your sister to try to identify any factors that seem to trigger or worsen your niece's stomach pain, and to keep track of when the pain occurs and how long it lasts. This information can be helpful for the doctor to understand the possible cause of the pain.
It's also important to continue giving your niece the erythromycin as prescribed, and to make sure she stays well hydrated by drinking plenty of fluids. If the pain becomes severe or your niece develops any new or concerning symptoms, it's always a good idea to seek medical attention.

If it's really bothering you try an elbow splint while sleeping. Also during the day avoid prolonged elbow bending and leaning on the elbows for prolonged periods of time.","It's possible that the numbness and tingling in your fingers and arm could be caused by carpal tunnel syndrome, but it's also possible that there could be other factors at play. Carpal tunnel syndrome is a condition that occurs when the median nerve, which runs from the forearm into the hand, becomes compressed at the wrist. This can cause symptoms such as numbness, tingling, and weakness in the hand and fingers.
There are a number of other factors that can cause these symptoms as well, such as nerve irritation or injury, muscle strain or overuse, or inflammation in the wrist or hand. It's also possible that the numbness and tingling could be related to your other medical issues, such as anemia or generalized anxiety disorder.
In order to determine the cause of your symptoms and get an accurate diagnosis, it would be best to see a doctor. They can perform a physical examination and may order additional tests, such as nerve conduction studies or imaging tests, to help determine the cause of your symptoms.
In the meantime, there are a few things you can try to help alleviate your symptoms:
1.	Take breaks from activities that involve repetitive hand or wrist movements, such as using a computer or phone for long periods of time.
2.	Use good posture and ergonomic techniques when using a computer or other devices.
3.	Avoid sleeping in positions that put pressure on your wrist or hand.

Don't kiss them. Don't do anything sexy with them. Don't kiss anyone that kisses them. Don't share drinks, toothbrushes, silverware, etc. Don't eat off each other's plates. Don't take a bite of something they bit into. Encourage them to not use public water fountains so they don't spread it to others. Encourage them to also cover their mouth when the cough so they don't spray their saliva on everything. Don't get an organ transplant from them in the near future. Otherwise, you're golden.","It's understandable that you are concerned about getting sick from your roommate who has mononucleosis (also known as ""kissing disease""). Here are some things you can do to reduce your risk of getting infected:
1.	Avoid close contact with your roommate, especially if they are experiencing symptoms such as fever, fatigue, or sore throat.
2.	Wash your hands frequently with soap and water, especially after touching shared surfaces or items.
3.	Avoid sharing personal items such as towels, cups, and utensils.
4.	If you need to use the same shower, try to avoid showering at the same time as your roommate, and use separate towels to dry off.
5.	It is not necessary for your roommate to wear a mask in and out of the room, as mononucleosis is primarily spread through saliva. However, if your roommate is experiencing symptoms such as coughing or sneezing, they should try to cover their mouth and nose with a tissue or elbow to reduce the risk of spreading respiratory droplets.
6.	If you are concerned about getting sick from your roommate, you may want to consider moving to a different room. You should also consider talking to your roommate about their behavior and how it is affecting your health. It is important for both of you to take steps to prevent the spread of infection to others.
It's also worth noting that mononucleosis is generally a self-limited illness, meaning that it will resolve on its own over time. Most people recover from mono within a few weeks to a couple of months, so the precautions you are taking should only be necessary for a limited period of time.

If you are experiencing any discomfort or symptoms such as abdominal pain, difficulty swallowing, or vomiting, it is important to contact a healthcare provider for further evaluation. However, if you are not experiencing any symptoms, it is safe to assume that the toothpick has passed through your digestive system and you do not need to be concerned.

2.	Abnormalities in the liver, gallbladder, or pancreas: An abdominal ultrasound can help to identify conditions such as liver cysts, gallstones, and pancreatitis.
3.	Kidney problems: An abdominal ultrasound can help to diagnose problems with the kidneys, such as kidney stones or an enlarged kidney.
4.	Ovarian cysts: A pelvic ultrasound can help to diagnose ovarian cysts, which are fluid-filled sacs that can develop on the ovaries.
5.	Uterine abnormalities: A pelvic ultrasound can help to diagnose problems with the uterus, such as fibroids or abnormalities in the shape or size of the uterus.
6.	Ectopic pregnancy: A pelvic ultrasound can help to diagnose an ectopic pregnancy, which is a pregnancy that occurs outside of the uterus.

Around a week after that I started feeling better &amp; back to normal, but after a short while I started to notice this lingering cough.

1.	Drink plenty of fluids, including water and warm liquids like tea or broth, to help thin out mucus and make it easier to cough up.
2.	Use a humidifier or take a hot shower to add moisture to the air, which can help loosen mucus and make it easier to cough up.
3.	Avoid irritants like tobacco smoke, strong perfumes, and pollution, as they can make your cough worse.

There are several options for managing medication-induced constipation, including:

Drinking plenty of fluids, such as water and fluids with electrolytes, to help soften stools and promote bowel movements.

Eating a diet high in fiber, including fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, to help add bulk to the stools and promote regular bowel movements.

Exercising regularly, as physical activity can help stimulate bowel movements.

Using over-the-counter laxatives, such as colace (docusate), to help soften stools and promote bowel movements.

23M Normal BMI no underlying conditions
Hello, Im very much going through major anxiety right now while I deal with an URI. My concern is that in the past 4 months I have had Covid, a minor viral infection, bronchitis, and this URI. The URI is kicking my butt and i'm terrified of going to the hospital or worse. I have to include that i was within close proximity of people that had these illnesses (aside the viral one, i went out to a bar and think I caught it there). My last illness was about 10 weeks ago.
I haven't had many illnesses before my Covid bought due to the lockdowns, i was sick maybe once in about a two year span, but recently my diet and stress has been maxed. With all these illnesses, my partner has not gotten sick from any so far. But with all the illnesses i am fearing i have leukemia or some form of cancer... should I get checked out by pcp? Does this indicate possible cancer at all?... I don't have any bruising/bleeding or shortness of breath.",yhnu17,iuewrqp,"Hi. We can't really equate having 4 infections to having cancer.

It could even just be chance!","It is completely normal to feel anxious about your health, especially when you have had several illnesses in a short period of time.

It is generally not uncommon to have several respiratory infections, such as colds, the flu, or bronchitis, in a short period of time, especially if you have been in close contact with people who have these illnesses. In some cases, a weakened immune system or other underlying health conditions may increase the risk of respiratory infections.

If you are concerned about your health and the frequency of your illnesses, it is a good idea to speak with your healthcare provider for further evaluation and guidance. Your healthcare provider can assess your symptoms, medical history, and overall health to determine the most appropriate course of action. This may include ordering tests to rule out other potential causes of your symptoms or providing recommendations for managing your health and preventing future illnesses.

It is important to take care of your physical and mental health by eating a healthy diet, getting plenty of rest, exercising regularly, and managing stress.

I see that this post might be a lot less extreme or important than others on this sub, so I appreciate your time for helping me out. 

I‰Ûªm a mixed martial artist with a fight coming up in November so I need to continue to train. Unfortunately at my day job, I cut my left index finger open and it only required three stitches. But now I‰Ûªm looking for advice to help me continue training heavily while not ruining the stitches on my index finger. I‰Ûªve been seeing conflicting things on using a liquid bandage over stitches, so I was hoping someone had some advice as to how I could protect the stitches and cut when I do lots of vigorous grip related training, as well as lots of sweating. 

As of right now, I have the liquid bandage mentioned, finger shaped gauze, and plenty of types of tape, including kino tape. Yes I spoke to my doctor about what I could do, but there was a language barrier that made it hard to tell him I couldn‰Ûªt just ‰ÛÏtake the week off‰Û� so close to competition.

Here are a few recommendations that may help:

Keep the wound clean and covered: It's important to keep the wound clean and covered to prevent infection and further injury. You can use a liquid bandage or a finger-shaped gauze to cover the stitches, and secure it in place with tape such as kino tape.

Avoid activities that put a lot of strain on the stitches: While it's okay to do some light training, it's important to avoid activities that put a lot of strain on the stitches. This might include activities that involve gripping or gripping heavy objects, as well as activities that cause sweating, as this can loosen the tape or gauze and expose the stitches.

Use padding: If you need to do activities that involve gripping or using your injured finger, you can try using padding around the finger to provide some protection for the stitches. You can use foam or a soft material to pad the finger, and secure it in place with tape.

Talk to your doctor: If you're unsure about what activities are safe to do with your stitches, it's always a good idea to talk to your doctor. They can provide specific recommendations based on your injury and the type of stitches you have.

Overall, it's important to protect your stitches and allow your finger to heal properly.

We use an unnecessarily fancy term for that: amaurosis fugax which means transient vision loss. It results from the retina not getting enough blood flow for a short period of time (the ophthalmic artery is the first to branch from the internal carotid artery and also has collateral flow from the external carotid in some people) and can be considered a stroke symptom, making it a TIA (transient ischemic attack: basically pre-stroke). Though since you're young, I wouldn't put a stenotic ICA or CCA on the top of my list as the ""sudden, short and quickly recovered loss of vision"" is more commonly a result of your blood pressure being too low for a short period of time. In other words your heart couldn't keep up to your brains oxygen (blood flow) needs for a short while but eventually adjusted, just a little bit late. If the symptom repeats, I would (if I were to see you as a patient in clinic or maybe the ER) refer you to a cardiologist and maybe also consider a brain vessel imaging (a CTA or MRA, whichever is preferred). Considering your history, dehydration may have exacerbated the issue so try to stay hydrated. A syncope event itself is mostly okay as blood flow to the brain is usually immediately recovered but falling down and hitting your head on something like concrete may not.","It is possible that your temporary loss of vision and other symptoms were caused by a temporary disruption in blood flow to your brain or eyes, or by a problem with the nerves that control your vision. However, it is also possible that these symptoms could be a sign of a more serious underlying condition, such as a stroke or a transient ischemic attack (TIA), also known as a ""mini-stroke.""

I would recommend that you seek medical attention as soon as possible. While you may not be able to afford a copay at this time, there are often options for low-cost or no-cost medical care, such as community health clinics or hospital emergency departments. It is important to get a proper evaluation and diagnosis to determine the cause of your symptoms and to receive appropriate treatment if needed.

In the meantime, try to take it easy and avoid strenuous activity until you have been evaluated by a healthcare provider.

N63,"23M - Colon cancer? Hi there, I've been noticing some strange things with myself lately, and doing a quick search online lead me to suggestions that I might have colon cancer. If this is the case, I can't afford treatment, let alone a doctors visit. Here's  what's been going on though, and apologies for TMI. 

3 or maybe 4 months ago, I noticed that I was pooping less frequently. My diets not the best (cheap junk food and bad balance in general), so I'm no stranger to constipation. So it wasn't anything new. When I was pooping though, and still to this day, the smell is this sickening weird death smell that I haven't had before until now, and the same thing for passing gas. No blood though, or any serious stomach pains which I read is a possible symptom of colon cancer. 

This smell though goes beyond that, and I am constantly smelling it while just passively breathing in. I thought maybe I have some kind of infection somewhere? Besides this though, I've been feeling more tired than normal. I'm an avid coffee drinker so I tried more coffee and that didn't help. No coffee at all, and I felt exactly the same somehow. I'll take a nap and wake up tired. Thought it could be vitamin deficiency but I'm always outside and taking b12s and all that.

If anyone has some words I would definitely appreciate it.",xwlknx,ir7f0am,This does not sound like cancer.

It's important to remember that colon cancer is just one possibility, and there are many other conditions that could be causing your symptoms. However, it is important to seek medical attention if you are experiencing any unusual or persistent symptoms, as early detection and treatment can improve the chances of a successful outcome.

There are a few potential causes of the symptoms you've described. It's possible that you could have an infection or a digestive disorder such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Constipation, changes in bowel movements, and abdominal pain are common symptoms of IBD.

It's also possible that you could have another type of cancer or a non-cancerous condition such as diverticulitis. Diverticulitis is a condition in which small pouches in the colon become infected or inflamed. Symptoms can include abdominal pain, changes in bowel movements, and fever.

If you are unable to afford medical treatment, there are resources available that may be able to help. Many hospitals and clinics have financial assistance programs for individuals who are unable to pay for medical care. You may also be able to find low-cost or free clinics in your area.

**If so, what should I ask for testing-wise when I make an appointment at the lab?**",xxa1hv,iraxavs,"Why are you doing a water fast? This is not advisable from a medical perspective. I don't know who is recommending this to you but this is pseudoscience.

I would not advise anyone to go through a ast for an extended amount of time, especially not for 21 days. You're putting yourself at serious risk of metabolic disturbances and harm.","It can be useful to track certain biomarkers before and after a water fast to get a sense of the physiological changes that occur during the fast. Some biomarkers that you may want to consider asking for when you make your appointment at the lab include:

Complete blood count (CBC): This test measures the number and types of cells in your blood, including red and white blood cells and platelets. During a water fast, you may see changes in your white blood cell count, which can provide information about your immune system function.

Electrolytes: This test measures the levels of electrolytes (such as sodium, potassium, and chloride) in your blood. Electrolytes play a crucial role in maintaining proper fluid balance in your body, and changes in electrolyte levels can occur during a water fast.

Kidney function tests: These tests measure the levels of creatinine, urea, and other substances in your blood that can indicate how well your kidneys are functioning. Water fasting can put stress on your kidneys, so it may be helpful to track your kidney function during the fast.

Liver function tests: These tests measure the levels of enzymes and other substances in your blood that can indicate how well your liver is functioning. Water fasting can put stress on your liver, so it may be helpful to track your liver function during the fast.

Lipid panel: This test measures the levels of cholesterol and other fats in your blood. A water fast may affect your lipid levels, so it can be useful to track them before and after the fast.

C-reactive protein (CRP): This is a protein produced by the liver in response to inflammation. Tracking CRP levels before and after a water fast may provide insight into the effects of the fast on inflammation in the body.

It's important to note that the specific tests you should request may depend on your individual health needs and concerns. It's a good idea to discuss your fasting plans with your healthcare provider and ask for their recommendations for testing. They can help you determine which tests are most appropriate for you and can provide guidance on how to interpret the results.",Physician,Physician,Physician,4,5,4,2,1,3,1,1,1,2,1,3,59,80

After 1.5 hour we got going again and I assumed everything was 'cleaned up'. It wasn't... I saw everything and it was things I did not want to see, ever. I don't understand why we drove past, I wouldn't have minded it if we waited another two hours, as long as I didn't have to see that. Also, what if people on the same train as me got triggered by it? I don't understand. 

Now, this happened at around 10 AM, it is currently 10.45 PM and I have been feeling so confused all day and keep thinking about it.

And like, I know I feel awful about it and that it is a sad thing that happened, but I only know because I knew beforehand that that is how I would feel about it. Idk if you can still follow me.. The whole day I've just been confused, not feeling anything, and whilst I can remember everything and I know what I saw, I feel like it's kinda vague and I feel like it hasn't happened. It's as if my brain is trying to cover up the memory. 
Also, when it happened and I saw it, I didn't realise what I was seeing until I put the puzzlepieces together. I can't fathom what I saw and it confuses me. 

I feel like a psychopath that I don't really feel anything, whilst normally I'm an extremely empathic person and cry easily over sad things. I know that this event is sad, but I don't feel anything, not sad, not angry, not annoyed, nothing. I know that it would upset me, but, now that I witnessed this event, it doesn't..

Prolapsed hemorrhoids are a type of internal hemorrhoid that has protruded through the anus and become visible outside the body. They can be painful and uncomfortable, and treatment may be necessary to alleviate symptoms and prevent complications.

To drain a prolapsed hemorrhoid, a healthcare provider will typically perform a procedure called a hemorrhoidectomy. This involves removing the prolapsed hemorrhoid tissue through a surgical incision. The procedure is usually performed under local anesthesia, which numbs the area around the anus so you don't feel pain during the procedure.

It's normal to feel anxious about having a surgical procedure, especially if you have chronic pain and other health conditions. It might be helpful to talk with your healthcare provider about your concerns and ask any questions you have about the procedure. They should be able to provide you with more information about what to expect and how to prepare for the procedure.

N80,"Pregnancy: Abnormal 12 Weeks Ultrasound My (34 F) doctor just called me to inform me about a prenatal ultrasound I had done 2 days ago.

I'm currently 12 weeks, I already had another ultrasound at 8 weeks and everything seemed normal. No issues with the pregnancy so far either.
This additional ultrasound was performed because my doctor told me this pregnancy is considered a ""geriatric pregnancy"".
The technician kept switching the transducer (?) and tried to get the baby to move more to be able to take better pictures. (""The baby is not cooperative"" was what she said.)
Baby was moving and normal heartbeat was measured. Technician printed pictures for me and congratulated me on the pregnancy.

When my OBGYN called today he told me that unfortunately something seems to be wrong with the baby, and asked if I already heard anything from the technician who did the ultrasound (I told him I did not).

He couldn't tell me what medical condition it was, he said that he had never seen this before, the only thing he could tell me was that we need another ultrasound next week to confirm, and that genetic specialists might have to talk to me.
He said that there might have been something wrong with the ultrasound machine, but he sounded so negative on the phone that it made me feel like this pregnancy won't be able to continue. 

When I asked him to be more specific, he mentioned the following
- Cavum Septum Pellucidum (CSP) not seen
- Nasal Bone absent
- Brain is normal size but couldn't see a cerebellum

I googled the CSP and found sites that mentioned it would be difficult to locate before 18 weeks.

I'm devastated right now and find it difficult being left with this information and having to wait for another week, that's why I'm seeking for advise here.

How likely is it that the technician just did a bad job or the ultrasound was not clear enough at 12 weeks, especially considering that so many features seem to be absent on the ultrasound? If the features are absent on the next ultrasound, what genetic disorder does this indicate and should I come to terms with the fact that this pregnancy most likely has to be terminated?
Anything experienced something similar before?

Thank you for your help.

Edit: Thank you for all your input so far.

I have asked for the report and it was sent to me.

These are the things mentioned as abnormal:

""Choroid/skull: Abnormal. Head has a rounded appearance. Chloroid plexus appears abnormal. No cerebellum seen. Cavum septum pellucidum not identified.
Abdominal wall/cord insertion: Abnormal. Omphalocele likely containing bowel just to the left of the cord insertion. Overall size measures approximately 8mm. There appears to be incomplete separation of the hemispheres with an apparent cortical defect.""

Everything else is listed as normal and nasal bone mentioned as identified; but then at the bottom of the report it sums up:

""Impression:
Single live fetus at 11 weeks 6 days.
Abnormal appearance head, cerebrum and cerebellum.
Absent nasal bone. Omphalocele.""",yf6kuh,iu3ugde,"The ultrasound that is performed around 11-13 weeks of pregnancy is very important in order to detect certain abnormalities that can be seen early in pregnancy. The one image you have provided does not help a lot. However, absent nasal septum can be a worrying sign, although not always indicative of an actual problem with the fetus since it can be seen later in pregnancy. I have seen mothers with small noses have fetuses that looked like that on ultrasound but were born completely normal. Regarding the brain abnormalities, some cannot be seen clearly so early in pregnancy and some can be corrected later on. If absence of cerebellum is confirmed however, it can turn out to be a very serious condition for the newborn and can lead to severe developmental delay and neurological problems later in life. 

You should for sure have another ultrasound by a specialist in that field. You might need also further testing, e.g. amniocentesis to confirm. I don't want to sound extremely alarming but you should also think about the possibility of terminating such a pregnancy if severe abnormalities are confirmed.

21F on no medications, no health issues, 190lb",y12xeu,irvf5pl,Completely normal.,"A holter monitor is a device that continuously records the electrical activity of your heart for a 24-hour period. The results of the holter monitor test are typically analyzed by a healthcare professional, such as a cardiologist, to determine whether there are any abnormalities in the rhythm or functioning of your heart.

In your case, the conclusion of the holter monitor test indicates that you have a normal sinus rhythm, which means that the electrical signals that coordinate your heartbeats are coming from the sinoatrial (SA) node, the natural pacemaker of the heart, and are happening at a normal rate. The results also indicate that you have rare supraventricular ectopic activity, which means that you have occasional extra heartbeats that originate from the atria or the atrioventricular (AV) node, rather than from the SA node. These extra heartbeats are also known as premature atrial contractions (PACs). PACs are relatively common and are usually not a cause for concern. They may be triggered by factors such as caffeine, alcohol, tobacco, stress, or lack of sleep, but they can also occur in people who are otherwise healthy.

The results also show that you do not have any ventricular ectopic activity, which means that you do not have any extra heartbeats originating from the ventricles, the lower chambers of the heart. This is good news, as ventricular ectopic activity can be a sign of a more serious heart condition.

Finally, the results indicate that your symptoms did not correlate with any dysrhythmia, which means that any symptoms you were experiencing, such as palpitations or shortness of breath, did not appear to be related to any abnormal heart rhythm.

In summary, the results of your holter monitor test indicate that you have a normal sinus rhythm and that you have rare supraventricular ectopic activity, which is not uncommon and is usually not a cause for concern. It is always a good idea to discuss the results of any medical test with your healthcare provider, so you may want to ask your doctor for more information or clarification about your test results.

### Narrative

EXAM: XR LUMBAR SPINE 2 OR 3 VIEWS  


Thank you!",y4f5ea,isdzawk,"* No freshly broken vertebrae; no evidence of vertebrae having been formerly broken and crushed either.
* Vertebrae are stacked well on top of each other, not sliding out from under each other. At the lower back the spinal column curves slightly to the left.
* At the border of the sacral bone and lumbar spine, the cartilage disc is deteriorating. The other cartilage discs also started to deteriorate mildly.
* Also the joints between the vertebrae show signs of wear, mostly at the border of the sacral bone and lumbar spine.
* No other significant findings.","Sure, I'd be happy to help! I'll do my best to explain the report in layman's terms:

The report is about an x-ray of your lower back, specifically the lumbar spine (the lower part of the spine that connects to the pelvis). The x-ray was taken from two or three different angles.

The report states that there is no evidence of any fractures (breaks) in the vertebrae (the bones that make up the spine). The heights of the vertebrae are normal. There is also no significant instability (movement) between the vertebrae.

The report notes that you have degenerative disc disease at the L5-S1 level. This means that the disc (the cushioning pad between the vertebrae) has become damaged and is not functioning as well as it should. The disc may also be slightly narrowed and there may be some bone spurs (extra bits of bone) on the endplates (the top and bottom of the disc).

The report also mentions mild facet arthropathy, which means that there is some wear and tear on the facet joints (the joints on the sides of the vertebrae). This is more pronounced at the L5-S1 level.

Overall, the report suggests that you have some degenerative changes in your lower back, but there are no other significant findings.",ChatGPT,ChatGPT,ChatGPT,5,4,4,5,5,5,1,1,2,3,4,4,130,207

Sex F

Height 5‰Ûª4‰Û�

Weight 160#

Race white 

Duration of complaint started Monday but have had hx of passing out on blood draws for 25+ years. No convulsions or loss of bladder control until this time. 

Location- at work 

Any existing relevant medical issues- had stated having migraines, tried taking topomax. Took 25 mg for 1 week, increased to 50. Could not tolerate due to memory and muscle effect. Went back down to 25 for a week then stopped taking. Last dose was 4 weeks ago. 

Non smoker. In peri menopause. 

Current medications- Vit D and B12. 

Monday morning I had my first ever episode of convulsive syncope vs seizure.  I was sitting, possibly dehydrated so glad to have it excused by my PCP as likely just vasovagal syncope with her telling me that workups would be overkill. Visited her day after it happened. (My other syncope was explainable due to blood draws and regularly occurs, no convulsive symptoms.) This episode however I had mild contractures and lost bladder control.

Have since talked to the dr who happened to be there when it happened and he suggests to follow through with ER doc recs for neurological and cardiac workups to rule out causes other than benign vasovagal. **I‰Ûªm honestly scared of over treatment**. Would love to know what y‰Ûªall think. Thanks!

Are you in medicine?,"It sounds like you had an episode that could potentially be a seizure or a case of vasovagal syncope (fainting). Vasovagal syncope is a common cause of fainting, and it is typically triggered by a specific event or condition, such as standing for a long time, seeing blood, or experiencing emotional stress. Seizures, on the other hand, are caused by abnormal electrical activity in the brain and can manifest in a variety of ways, including convulsions, loss of consciousness, and loss of bladder control.

Given that you have a history of fainting during blood draws, your primary care doctor may have assumed that your episode was vasovagal syncope. However, the fact that you had convulsions and lost bladder control during this episode raises the possibility that it could have been a seizure. It is important to rule out other potential causes, such as a cardiac or neurological issue, in order to determine the most appropriate treatment.

I would recommend following the recommendations of the ER doctor and undergoing the recommended workups, such as a neurological and cardiac evaluation.

N90,"What other kind of testing do I ask for following recent admission to hospital &amp; receiving negative EEG after multiple fainting episodes?? [23F, Hispanic, 131 lbs, recently diagnosed with vertigo, Vasovagal syncope, and possibly POTS Syndrome, primary issue has happened over the course of the past week or so]

So, I‰Ûªm feeling very overwhelmed here. I‰Ûªve never been diagnosed with epilepsy. I‰Ûªve had doctors toss around the idea of ‰ÛÏabsence seizures‰Û� when I would have spells of zoning out over the past few years. I also used to faint randomly. That stopped for a few years. 

Fast forward to this week, I‰Ûªm having issues again; but worse-

Monday: I went to the ER because I‰Ûªve been getting some messed up vertigo symptoms. I felt very off. They told me the vertigo was related to my bp &amp; hr dropping and going up upon position changes (think they mentioned POTS?)

Tuesday night: I pass out at home after feeling light headed for a while. 
This time (unlike times in previous years) I am out, unconscious on the floor. When I wake up I get told my eyes were fluttering and I wasn‰Ûªt responding. I was out maybe 3 minutes. I still had trouble speaking after waking up.

Wednesday morning: I got to work, my head was killing me in one specific spot in the back of my head for a few hours. Pain started to get intense, started getting heart palpitations, light headed was returns- BOOM, hit the ground - unconscious yet again. One of my co-workers found me, I wasn‰Ûªt responding and I was randomly twitching. My eyes were open but fluttering again. He called an ambulance and once the medics got there (literally within 2 minutes) they tried to wake me up but I wasn‰Ûªt responding still. I was in and out by this point but I couldn‰Ûªt speak or move. I heard him say my eyes were all over the place, next thing I knew he was digging his knuckles into my sternum and that mostly got me conscious again. When I opened my eyes I was dead confused and felt like I was about to slip out again. They brought me to the hospital and the doctor was ready to chalk it up to a migraine until it happened again while she was right next to me. 
Then she decided I needed to be seen by neurology and I was admitted. 

While I waited a few hours for neurology, the nurses noticed my eyes, tried to wake me up but I was again unable to speak or move. More knuckles into my sternum.
They got a rush order for an EEG (still took a few hours to get) but they only did it for about 35 mins and that was with breaks because I had to keep using the bathroom. Once the test was done and read- they said it came back normal and that it was not seizures. I was told it was Vasovagal syncope + vertigo and potentially POTS Syndrome. 

Friday: took day off from work to rest as I felt off still. 

Today at work: started to get odd sensation in back of my head like a tickle or skin crawling feeling almost that moved into back of my neck. Started to feel a bit of twitchiness. Feeling got more intense in my head and I felt myself checking out again. My co worker made sure I was safe and tried to wake me up. He said my eyes again were all over the place and fluttery, and this time I was super twitchy. He had to give me a few minutes after I was awake again because I still couldn‰Ûªt speak right after.  

I just got a notification that the EEG report posted to my portal so I looked at it (even though I am aware I was told it was normal). I read it, it says ‰ÛÏNo epileptiform abnormalities are appreciated‰Û�(I.e-normal), but in the beginning of the report it‰Ûªs says ‰ÛÏsubsequently witnessed to have episode of R head turn and unresponsiveness c/f seizure.‰Û� 

I know I‰Ûªm not a doctor, I have no clue about any of this, but I feel like I need medication. My body feels SO exhausted after every episode and it‰Ûªs draining me.I just need to know what the hell is going on or what I should do. I‰Ûªm also taking a break from driving for now to be safe.

Please shed ANY light on this. I have a child to chase around and need to get better.",ybnvz5,iti7fyp,"These are atypical symptoms and while I've learned anything can be seizure it can also be other things.

- I'd try my best to keep hydrated, alongside a high salt diet for now to see whether that gets you feeling better. If this helps, would be suggestive of POTS or vasovagal spells (you can youtube ""the fainting lark"" for examples of passing out that look like seizures).

- agree with not driving for now just in case, as you seem exhausted regardless, even if these aren't seizures

- consider requesting an ambulatory eeg via a neurologist or your doc. You'd essentially just wear an eeg for several days, and since you have these spells frequently, are likely to get an answer 

- empiric seizure med could also be tried. Depends on the doc and their comfort level with trying something but something like topiramate could help both prevent migraines and seizures.","It sounds like you have been experiencing a number of concerning symptoms, including fainting episodes, vertigo, and difficulty speaking and moving after waking up. It is important that you continue to follow up with your healthcare provider to address these issues and determine the cause.

Based on the information you provided, it sounds like your healthcare provider has already ruled out epilepsy as the cause of your fainting episodes and has instead diagnosed you with vasovagal syncope and possibly POTS syndrome. Vasovagal syncope is a type of fainting that occurs when the body overreacts to certain triggers, such as standing for a long time or experiencing strong emotions, and the heart rate and blood pressure drop suddenly. POTS syndrome is a condition in which the heart rate increases significantly upon standing up, leading to symptoms such as lightheadedness, fainting, and fatigue.

In addition to your EEG, which is a test that measures brain activity, there may be other tests that your healthcare provider may recommend to further evaluate your symptoms and determine the cause. For example, they may recommend a tilt table test, which is a test that helps to determine if your fainting episodes are due to a problem with the regulation of blood pressure and heart rate. They may also recommend other tests such as an echocardiogram, which is an ultrasound of the heart, or a Holter monitor, which is a device that records heart activity for a period of time.

It is also important to consider whether there are any triggers or factors that may be contributing to your fainting episodes. For example, if you have been experiencing vertigo, it may be helpful to avoid activities that may exacerbate this symptom, such as looking up or down for a long time or standing for extended periods of time. If you have been diagnosed with POTS syndrome, your healthcare provider may recommend lifestyle modifications such as increasing your fluid and salt intake, avoiding prolonged standing or sitting, and avoiding certain medications that may worsen your symptoms.

In the meantime, it is important that you take care of yourself and prioritize your health. If you are experiencing any symptoms that are concerning or that interfere with your daily activities, it is important to speak with your healthcare provider as soon as possible.

I (26M, 179cm, 59kg, no smoking/alcohol/drugs) recently went to a clinic because I tend to black out after mild exertion, (like running to the bus), and had an ECG. The results were apparently a bit unusual with a T-wave inversion in V1-V2. After consulting a cardiologist my Dr. told me this could be a sign of either:

A previous heart attack, or 
A natural phenomenon that can be seen in young, tall, skinny people.

This fascinates me, because those two possibilites feel about as far apart as you could get. While I certainly fit the latter category, severe coronary heart disease runs in the family so I am a bit nervous.

I will be having a bunch of tests done sometime in the near future, but out of curiosity I've been reading about this to try and understand why a result like this could indicate two such different things.

As far as I can gather, the inversion is present after an infarction due to electrically dead scar tissue. But it is also common in children and can sometime remain into early adulthood. I can't find any info on why this happens in kids though, and would be grateful if anyone with some insight could explain.

Thanks!",y2cyht,is2f9vn,T-wave inversion in V1 and V2 is completely normal; these leads are supposed to have T-wave inversion.,"T-wave inversion on an electrocardiogram (ECG) refers to a specific pattern in the shape of the T wave, which is a small deflection on the ECG tracing that follows the QRS complex. T-wave inversion can be a normal finding in some individuals, particularly in certain leads (V1-V4) in young, healthy individuals. However, T-wave inversion can also be seen in individuals who have had a heart attack, as you mentioned.

The cause of T-wave inversion in individuals who have had a heart attack is typically due to scarring of the heart muscle that occurs after a heart attack. The scar tissue does not conduct electrical impulses as well as normal heart muscle, which can result in abnormal ECG findings, including T-wave inversion.

T-wave inversion can also occur in individuals who have not had a heart attack and may be a normal finding in some individuals. This is more commonly seen in young, healthy individuals, particularly in leads V1-V4. In these individuals, the cause of T-wave inversion is not well understood, but it is thought to be related to the electrical activity of the heart in these individuals.

It is important to note that T-wave inversion on an ECG can have multiple causes and is not always indicative of a heart problem.

They can help you understand what screenings are appropriate for you based on your age, medical history, and other factors.

If they persist for longer than 2-4 weeks after the most recent infection or continue to grow would get checked out.,"It's natural to be concerned when you or a loved one notices a swollen lymph node. However, it's important to remember that swollen lymph nodes can have many different causes, and most of the time they are not due to lymphoma or any other serious condition.

Common causes of swollen lymph nodes include infections (such as a cold or strep throat), inflammation, or injury. Lymph nodes may also swell in response to other conditions, such as allergies or autoimmune disorders. In many cases, swollen lymph nodes are a normal and temporary response to these types of conditions, and they will go down on their own once the underlying issue has been resolved.

Given that your father has recently had a cold and strep throat, it's likely that the swollen lymph node is related to one of these conditions. However, it's always a good idea to have any swollen lymph nodes checked out by a doctor, especially if they are accompanied by other symptoms or if they persist for an extended period of time. The doctor will be able to examine the swollen lymph node and order any necessary tests to help determine the cause.

In the meantime, it's generally a good idea to encourage your father to take good care of himself by eating a healthy diet, getting plenty of rest, and staying hydrated. If he has any concerns or if the swollen lymph node does not go down after a few weeks, he should contact his doctor for further evaluation and advice.",Physician,ChatGPT,ChatGPT,4,5,4,4,5,5,5,1,3,1,4,3,34,132

They did three bouts of gamma knife radiation and got rid of a lot of it, though not all. It's still large, but stable. However, from the radiation, I had a blood vessel collapse. This gave me a stroke in which I have partial paralysis on my right side. 

Through my adolescent years, I went to both physical and occupational therapy. They saw improvement, but with me being a kid/preteen/teenager, I wouldn't really do exercises at home,  therefore the improvement that they saw pretty much faded. 

Now, in my 30s, I've pretty much given up on my right side. I can still feel on that side. I can walk, but with a limp. My arm is bent up and barely able to straighten. My fingers are always closed. They get tighter and my arm bends even more when I'm stressed. I have two little kids and a husband to care for and a part time job at a daycare. I finally started getting SSDI a few years ago.

Some are designed to provide basic functions, such as gripping and holding objects, while others are more advanced and can mimic the movements and functions of a natural hand.

They will also be able to provide you with information about the potential benefits and limitations of using a prosthetic arm and hand, as well as the training and therapy that would be required to learn how to use the device effectively.

This finding could potentially represent early chronic microvascular ischemic change, which means there may be changes in the small blood vessels in this part of the brain that could be related to decreased blood flow. This type of change is often seen in people with chronic conditions that can affect blood flow to the brain, such as high blood pressure or diabetes. It's also possible that this finding could be related to other factors, such as a previous injury or infection.

It's important to note that this finding on your CT scan alone is not sufficient to determine the cause of your symptoms or to make a definitive diagnosis. Further evaluation, such as an MRI, may be needed to fully understand the cause of your symptoms and determine the appropriate treatment. Your neurologist is in the best position to discuss the potential implications of this finding and how it may be related to your symptoms and overall health.

Hey! For 2-3 years now i have had a very low pulse imo. In the beginnig of this i didnt eat much and i went from 86kg down to 55kg, because of health anxiety. Im much better now. Im not super athletic at all, i only go for 1-2 walks a day for 1 hour +. I dont work atm and im usually at home. Last BP was 130/66. I had 2 ECGs in july, they were good. 

So, i can have a full blown panick attack and my pulse will still be like 46-60 and i breathe very slow, feels like i cant ""normally"" breathe faster. My pulse increases when i stand and when i walk etc and ive had like 166 when walking up a hill, i never get tired, and i walk fast. 

Peak Flow Meter is 500-600 and my Spo2 is always 97-99%.

She told me that i had no need to go to a cardiologist unless i started passing out occasionally etc.

Non smoker, social drinker (2-3x week) no family history of clots or cardiac issues save for maternal grandma - Polycythemia Vera

Hello ! So I was hospitalized two weeks ago for sudden and first time PSVT post COVID ‰ÛÓ had a complete cardiac work up and 2 day admission to tele which showed no further arrhythmia. Echo was normal EJ 55-60%. 

I was sent back to ER yesterday after a couple days of leg pain and being winded, doc wanted to rule out clots after bed rest. They did an ultrasound on leg which was normal, and a D Dimer with results of &lt;150 ng/mL. Troponin draw was 0.000 (on admission 2 weeks ago it was 0.051 after the arrhythmia which was sustained 15 mins prior to self resolution, after ice water on my face). Told this all but rules out any clots, but don‰Ûªt understand the way it is expressed in numbers?

What does this value of D Dimer mean ? Is this negative or should it say 0.000 as the Troponin ? I am seeing an EP Cardiologist soon for possible further tests and Holter as well.

Thank you kindly in advance !",xzopwc,irnahr3,"D-dimer is a byproduct of clot formation, so anytime a clot forms some d-dimer will form as well. The bigger the clot the more the d-dimer. Naturally the body is constantly forming clots from microtrauma to blood vessels due to normal wear and tear. But also after getting an injury, like blood drawn for lab work. Ultimately that means that you will always have some d-dimer amount in your blood. Which is what makes it a horrible test in most applications, very sensitive to almost anything and very not specific to almost anything.

Troponin is a protein that is part of muscle, in your case they were looking for cardiac troponin (from the heart). It is only supposed to be in the heart muscle cells. If any of it is in the blood that means there was heart muscle breakdown and the troponin ""leaked"" into the blood from within the muscle cells of the heart. The more heart muscle damage, the higher the troponin level. So ideally you should have none in your blood.

This is an oversimplification but the gist of it.","The D-dimer test is a blood test that measures the amount of a protein fragment called D-dimer in the blood. This protein is produced when a blood clot breaks down. The presence of high levels of D-dimer in the blood may be a sign of clotting, although other factors can also cause elevated levels.

The normal range for D-dimer levels can vary depending on the specific test used and the laboratory that performs the test. In general, a D-dimer level of less than 150 ng/mL is considered normal. This means that your D-dimer level is within the normal range and does not suggest the presence of a blood clot.

It's important to note that a normal D-dimer result does not completely rule out the presence of a blood clot. Other tests, such as an ultrasound, may be needed to confirm the presence or absence of a clot. It's also important to note that D-dimer levels can be elevated for other reasons, such as after surgery or after a recent injury.

It's good that you are seeing a cardiologist for further evaluation. They will be able to review your test results and medical history, and recommend any necessary further testing or treatment.

So I'm a 20M and I regularly look for any skin or body irregularities in the shower.

When I get there and tell him I regularly self-assess for any changes he looks at me with an unbelievably demeaning expression and with a matching tone goes *""Buddy, you're 20.""*

N115,"Secretion/saliva in disabled child

Hello, my son (6) has a rare genetic/peroxisomal disorder and is completely dependent on us for everything. He has no head control and is very much like a baby in terms of his activity and self care.  

He has a GTube for feeding and receives nothing by mouth due to aspirating everything.  

He constantly battles excess saliva.  A scope showed a constant stream of bubbly saliva all the way down his throat.  His tonsils are not large and all looks well functionally but it‰Ûªs just a steady stream of bubbles.  

We are constantly wiping his face and at night he coughs/gags and we use a suction machine with a little sucker attached to clear out his mouth and nose.  

He previously was on Robinol to help halt the secretions but he had bad side effects and we stopped.  His ENT recommended a cough assist machine which we use but feel like it does nothing.  

Another option we had discussed was Botox but we‰Ûªre told there are some serious side effects with that as well.  

We are looking for recommendations or advice on alternative treatments",xwv8zi,ir8oanx,Botox is reasonable to trial to see if it would be helpful in reducing the symptoms.

This would obviously be a decently extensive surgery which I'd argue has more side effects than botox.,"It sounds like your son is experiencing excessive saliva production, which can be a challenging and distressing symptom for both him and you as his caretakers. Excessive saliva production, or sialorrhea, can be caused by a variety of factors, including neurological conditions, medications, and structural abnormalities in the mouth or throat.

Treatment for sialorrhea depends on the underlying cause, and may involve medications, behavioral interventions, and/or surgical procedures.

Some possible medications that may help to reduce saliva production include anticholinergic drugs (such as glycopyrrolate or scopolamine), beta blockers (such as propranolol or atenolol), and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (such as fluoxetine or sertraline). However, it's important to note that these medications can have side effects, and it may take some trial and error to find the most effective and tolerable treatment for your son.

Behavioral interventions, such as positioning your son in a way that allows gravity to help drain saliva away from his mouth, or using a chin-down posture, can also be helpful in managing sialorrhea. You may also want to try using absorbent materials, such as gauze or a bib, to help keep your son's face dry.

If your son's sialorrhea is due to a structural abnormality in his mouth or throat, such as a blockage or an anatomic abnormality, surgical intervention may be necessary. Botox injections into the salivary glands can also be an option in some cases, but as you mentioned, there can be serious side effects associated with this treatment.

It's important to work closely with your son's healthcare team to determine the most appropriate treatment for his sialorrhea.

However, it's important to try to determine the cause of the bleeding so that it can be treated appropriately. Bleeding from the rectum or anus can have many different causes, some of which may be serious.

There are a few common causes of rectal bleeding that might be worth considering:

Hemorrhoids: Hemorrhoids are swollen veins in the anus and rectum. They can cause itching, discomfort, and bleeding. Hemorrhoids are often caused by straining during bowel movements, sitting for long periods of time, or constipation.

Anal fissures: Anal fissures are small tears in the skin around the anus. They can cause pain and bleeding, especially during bowel movements. Anal fissures are often caused by constipation or passing large or hard stools.

Inflammatory bowel disease: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a group of conditions that cause inflammation in the digestive tract. Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease are two types of IBD. Both can cause rectal bleeding, as well as abdominal pain, diarrhea, and other symptoms.

Other possible causes: Other possible causes of rectal bleeding include anal cancer, rectal cancer, and rectal polyps.

It's important to see a doctor for an evaluation if you experience rectal bleeding. Your doctor will be able to determine the cause of the bleeding and recommend appropriate treatment. In the meantime, you can try to manage your symptoms by:

Drinking plenty of fluids
Eating a high-fiber diet to help prevent constipation

However, the information you have provided suggests that the pain in your right upper quadrant could potentially be related to your gastroparesis or your pancreas.

Gastroparesis is a condition in which the muscles of the stomach do not work properly, resulting in delayed emptying of the stomach and difficulty digesting food. It can cause abdominal pain, bloating, and other digestive symptoms. Elevated amylase and liver enzymes can also be a sign of pancreatitis, which is inflammation of the pancreas.

The presence of a cyst on your pancreas is also a possible contributing factor to your pain. Pancreatic cysts are fluid-filled sacs that can develop in the pancreas. Some pancreatic cysts are benign (non-cancerous), while others are malignant (cancerous). It is important to follow up with your healthcare provider for proper evaluation and management of your condition.

It is also possible that the pain could be due to other factors, such as acid reflux or gallbladder disease.

I did 12 hours of water and food deprivation to test for reasons for extreme thirst leading to headaches and a general inflammation response, with diabetes insipidus being what's suspected.

The results came in the next day, but I haven't heard from the doctor in three weeks. I've called twice, once last week and once this week, and spoke to the receptionist who, both times, first says ""the results are in your mychart"" and when I respond ""yes, I'm looking for the interpretation of these results"" says she'll pass along the message.

You would probably need a hypertonic saline infusion until you reach one of two end points, sodium &gt; 145 or urine osmolality &gt; 700.  If the urine osmolality criteria is the end point you reach then you would have Primary Polydipsia.  If the sodium criteria is what you reach, you‰Ûªd need a desmopressin stimulation test, and based on that result you could determine which type, if any, diabetes insipidus you may have.

Diabetes insipidus is a condition in which the body is unable to properly regulate the amount of water in the body due to a deficiency of the hormone vasopressin, which helps the kidneys retain water.

The high urine osmolality (438) and low blood osmolality (291) in your test results suggest that you are experiencing abnormal levels of water in your body, which can be a sign of diabetes insipidus. The other test results you provided do not seem to be consistent with diabetes insipidus, but it is important to consider them in the context of your overall medical history and any other symptoms you may be experiencing.

There are several other, safer methods you can try to help you wake up on time and feel more alert during the day:

Get plenty of sleep: Make sure you are getting enough sleep at night to help you feel rested and alert during the day. Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep per night.

Practice good sleep hygiene: Establish a consistent bedtime routine and create a sleep-friendly environment (e.g., keep the bedroom cool, dark, and quiet). Avoid screens and caffeine close to bedtime.

Use an alarm clock: Set an alarm clock to wake you up at the same time each day, and place it across the room so you have to get out of bed to turn it off.

Get some sunlight: Expose yourself to natural light as soon as you wake up to help regulate your body's natural sleep-wake cycle.

Exercise: Regular physical activity can help you sleep better and feel more alert during the day.

Some surgeons may prefer to give a dose, but its not mandated. Given your history and concern for c diff, it would certainly be reasonable to not give a pre-op dose of IV abx.","It is generally recommended to receive antibiotics before and during surgery to help prevent the development of infections. However, it is understandable that you are concerned about the potential side effects of antibiotics and the risk of developing Clostridioides difficile (C. diff) infection.

It is important to discuss your concerns with your surgeon and healthcare team. They can assess the specific risks and benefits of receiving antibiotics in your case and help you make an informed decision. It may be possible to use alternative infection prevention strategies, such as thorough skin preparation, sterilization of the surgical site, and use of sterile technique during the surgery.

It is also important to consider the type of surgery you are having and the potential risks of infection. Some surgeries, such as those involving the respiratory tract, bladder, or intestines, may be at higher risk for infection. Your surgeon can provide more information about the specific risks in your case and help you weigh the risks and benefits of receiving antibiotics.

If you decide not to receive antibiotics, it is important to take steps to reduce the risk of infection. These may include practicing good hygiene, such as washing your hands frequently and keeping the surgical wound clean and dry. It may also be helpful to follow a healthy diet and get plenty of rest to support your immune system.

All was going well until I started having facial twitching when wearing the device and shocks inside my head. After some back and forth with my clinic I decided to just stop using it and move on. 

Since then I‰Ûªve had the following symptoms slowly grow worse or become more consistent. I‰Ûªve been diagnosed with depression, anxiety, slightly enlarged left thyroid, generalized fatigue/hypersomnia. I saw an ENT in Nov 2021 who felt a lump on the right side of my neck and had a CT done. My complaints and reason for seeing the ENT included headaches, neck pain, very visible asymmetrical swelling on my right neck/jawline, mild swallowing difficulties/chronic cough (I‰Ûªve had a cough since 2019). These were the findings:

2021 FINDINGS: No definite CT evidence of a discrete mass within the right parotid gland. No definite evidence of disproportionate enhancement, radiopaque calculi or ductal dilatation to the parotid gland on the right. Submandibular glands, muscles of mastication, tongue, floor of mouth, pharynx, larynx appear unremarkable. No definite enlarged lymph nodes within the neck. Few phleboliths noted within the palatine tonsils. Asymmetry in the size of the thyroid glands with the right appearing larger than the left. No definite CT evidence of a discrete nodule within the thyroid. Streak artifact coursing through the thyroid from the patient shoulders. Nasal septum deviated to the right with a prominent spur abutting the inferior turbinate. Paranasal sinuses appear unopacified. Partial mastoidectomy changes noted on the right with a metallic device extending into the middle ear cavity incompletely seen on this study. Partial opacification of the remaining inferior mastoid air cells. Prominent degenerative changes within the cervical spine most pronounced at C5-C6 and C6-C7. Mild to moderate neural foramina narrowing on the right  at C5-C6.

IMPRESSION:
1. No definite CT evidence of a discrete mass within the parotid gland.
2. Mild nonspecific enlargement of the thyroid on the right relative to the left.
3. Partial mastoidectomy changes noted on the right with a metallic device extending into the middle ear cavity.

My ENT wrote ‰ÛÏno discreet mass was noted. I think it was fullness of the SCM in that area you are feeling. Have a nice day!‰Û� The doctor then rejected my request for a follow up appointment. I didn‰Ûªt feel a lump, she did! I went in for neck pain and headaches and she found the lump. 

I wrote down everything I‰Ûªve complained about in the last five years and finally made the connection this was all probably due to cochlear implant failure/migration. I don‰Ûªt see the doctor frequently (why bother?) but when I do they give me more antidepressants. I had bad anxiety for awhile in 2020, but have no emotional or cognitive complaints. 

After a month and 11 follow up calls I finally got an appointment to begin the removal process at Mayo Clinic, where it was implanted. I am also having a sleep study done in November. I had a home one done and have mild apnea (6 incidents per hour) that shouldn‰Ûªt be making me fatigued/hypersomniac. 

I need someone to review the big picture and let me know if I sound crazy. I want to know if all of this will go away with the explanation or if I‰Ûªm doomed to have a fat right jawline and neck for the rest of my life. I also want to know how mad I should be at my doctors. Thanks!",xzqrvh,irp0zq9,"Nothing you are experiencing is due to the cochlear implant, and it doesn't really sound like it failed. It isn't uncommon to have some stimulation of the facial nerve with the device. An audiologist fixes that by changing the electrode stimulations such that it doesn't do that. If there are zaps or other concerning things, an audiologist can interrogate it to determine what is going on. You may be perceiving facial stimulation as zaps. Either way, this wouldn't have anything to do with what you are experiencing in the neck. 

I don't know what's going on in the neck, the CT was unremarkable and your physician didn't seem to find anything that was concerning. Without an examination can't say much more.","It is understandable that you are seeking clarification on the potential relationship between your cochlear implant and your various symptoms. It is important to note that the findings from your CT scan do not indicate a definite connection between your cochlear implant and your symptoms. The impression from the CT scan mentions the presence of a metallic device in the middle ear cavity and degenerative changes in the cervical spine, but does not mention any issues with the cochlear implant itself.

It is also important to note that the presence of a lump on your neck and asymmetry in the size of your thyroid glands may have multiple potential causes, and it would be necessary to seek further evaluation and testing to determine the specific cause of these findings. It is possible that the mild nonspecific enlargement of the thyroid on the right relative to the left could be related to the slightly enlarged left thyroid that you mentioned you have been diagnosed with in the past.

As for the fatigue and hypersomnia that you have experienced, it is possible that these symptoms could be related to the mild apnea that you have been diagnosed with, or they could have other potential causes. It is important to follow up with a healthcare professional to determine the cause of these symptoms and discuss appropriate treatment options.

In terms of your concerns about the appearance of your neck and jawline, it is important to note that the CT scan did not mention any definitive findings related to these areas. It is possible that the fullness of the SCM (sternocleidomastoid muscle) that your ENT mentioned could be contributing to the appearance of your neck and jawline, but further evaluation would be necessary to determine the specific cause and appropriate treatment options.

In summary, while it is possible that your cochlear implant and the associated surgery could potentially be related to some of your symptoms, it is important to seek further evaluation and testing to determine the specific causes and appropriate treatment options.

I don't know if there's good data on when to stop secondhand exposure but I'd assume the sooner the better for both you and your spouse,"It is generally recommended to avoid secondhand exposure to vapor from electronic cigarettes or other vaping devices prior to surgery. This is because nicotine, which is present in many e-cigarette liquids, can affect your blood vessels and heart rate, and may interfere with the action of certain medications used during surgery. Additionally, inhaling vapor from these devices can irritate the respiratory system and potentially increase the risk of respiratory complications during and after surgery.

It is difficult to determine the specific level of exposure you may be experiencing, as it will depend on factors such as the type and strength of the e-cigarette liquid your spouse is using, the amount of vapor they are exhaling, and the ventilation in your home. However, it is generally recommended to minimize your exposure to secondhand vapor as much as possible, especially in the days leading up to your surgery. This could involve limiting the time you spend in the same room as your spouse while they are using their e-cigarette, and increasing ventilation by opening windows or using an air purifier.

If you are concerned about the potential effects of secondhand vapor on your surgery, it may be helpful to discuss this with your healthcare provider. They can provide guidance on how to minimize your exposure and address any specific concerns you may have.

I came into the ER for left side and back pain.. they ordered a CT, and everything looks fine except for this‰Û_

What does this mean??

Hepatobiliary: The liver has a normal size with a smooth surface. Mildly low attenuation of the hepatic parenchyma consistent with steatosis. There is a subcentimeter low-attenuation lesion in the medial segment of the left hepatic lobe, too small to characterize by CT but statistically likely benign. The portal veins are patent. There is no biliary dilatation and the gallbladder is unremarkable with no calcified stones.


Thanks :(",y0sjd9,irtudzj,"It's probably a liver cyst. So many people have them but if they are less than a centimeter, we technically don't have enough information to just flat out say it's a simple liver cyst due to the resolution limitations of a CT. Literally nothing to worry about. It likely wasn't mentioned on your part CT because either the radiologist missed it, that last CT was poorer quality, or it is new/larger (which again is normal, cysts tend to slooooowly grow over time until whatever size they decide to stop at).

I'm a radiology resident, so I spit this line out almost daily lol","I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling worried. It's understandable to have concerns when something unexpected shows up on a medical test. It's important to keep in mind that the presence of a subcentimeter liver lesion does not necessarily mean that there is something seriously wrong. In many cases, subcentimeter liver lesions are benign (not cancerous) and do not cause any symptoms or require treatment.

However, it's also possible that the lesion could be something more serious, such as a cancerous tumor. The only way to be sure is to have the lesion further evaluated. Your healthcare provider will be able to recommend the best course of action based on your specific situation.

It's also worth noting that the presence of a liver lesion does not necessarily explain the pain that you were experiencing in your left side and back. There could be other explanations for this pain, and it's important to follow up with your healthcare provider to determine the cause.

On 10/14 I had 3 wisdom teeth removed. My top 2 wisdom teeth had been emerged for years, my bottom left tooth was impacted and had began an infection 1 week prior, and I di not have a lower right wisdom tooth.
All 3 were extracted on 10/14. I've been healing well and careful with what I eat, only eating more solid foods in the last 2-3 days.

When my infection started I was prescribed amoxicillin 500mg 4x/day. I did that until my surgery, after which I was prescribed penicillin 500mg 4x/day. I had taken the penicillin up until 2 days ago, when I stopped (so 4-5 days after surgery). I don't like the harmful, sometimes permanent effects that destroying your gut microbiome can have and I want to mitigate that as much as possible.

I started getting paranoid about getting an infection in the lower left again and I took a penicillin, thinking I'd run it for another 2-3 days. But then I thought, what if I broke a pill and placed it gently directly on the socket that I'm worried about.

Would this be effective at treating it locally and mitigating the systemic effects of the antibiotics? As I said, I have both amoxicillin and penicillin, if one is somehow better than the other.

To be clear, I am asking about the efficacy of my proposal. I'm not interested in hearing about how some of you might think that the gut microbiome is a non-factor.

This would be a better approach to treating your infection with proper antibiotic use and limiting your risk.","It is not recommended to apply amoxicillin or penicillin directly to the wisdom tooth socket.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for taking the time to read this.

I have been pursuing a long distance relationship for around 4-5 months with a wonderful woman. We plan to meet  soon, and she told me quite recently that a while ago on one of her screenings (way before we met)  she  has HPV. She seemed pretty upset about it. (Her last partner berated her for it)

She mentioned that it means she has a higher risk of getting cancer, and she has a wart on her finger because of it? Her doctor didn't elaborate on exactly what type etc and i have no idea if it will go away? Her doctor also told her she doesn't have to inform partners about it.

I am a 30yr old man, and have not had any vaccines for HPV. (I didn't even know about it)

&amp;#x200B;

My question is, what do i do? What affect will it have on me? If i get vaccinated against it can i still catch it? It seems the majority of what i have seen seems to say that most people will have it in some form, and it's nothing to worry about really.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd really appreciate advice on this!",yfm6uf,iu4o57y,"Chances are you have HPV too. It is super super common, before the vaccine about 50% of people had it. There is no proven benifits at getting the vaccine at your age due to the fact that you likely already have it

Honestly, I would not worry about it","Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a very common virus that is spread through sexual contact. There are many different types of HPV, and some can cause health problems, such as genital warts and certain types of cancer. Other types of HPV have no visible symptoms and may go away on their own.

It's understandable that you may have concerns about your partner's HPV infection, but it's important to remember that HPV is very common and most people who have it do not have any serious health problems as a result. While HPV can increase the risk of certain types of cancer, including cervical cancer, most people with HPV do not develop cancer.

If you are not already vaccinated against HPV, you may want to consider getting the HPV vaccine. The vaccine can help protect against the types of HPV that are most likely to cause cancer. It is most effective when given to people who have not yet been exposed to HPV, so it is generally recommended for people who are younger than 26 years old. Even if you have already been exposed to HPV, you may still benefit from vaccination, as the vaccine can protect against some types of HPV that you have not yet been exposed to.

It is up to your partner to decide whether or not to disclose their HPV infection to you or to future partners. However, it is important for both partners to be honest with each other about their sexual health and to discuss ways to reduce the risk of transmission. This can include using condoms and/or dental dams during sexual activity, and getting vaccinated against HPV.

In the end, the most important thing is to have an open and honest conversation with your partner about your concerns and to make decisions together about how to protect each other's health.

It is available in both a topical form (applied to the skin) and an oral form. While it is generally safe to use, there are some potential side effects to be aware of.

The most common side effects of topical minoxidil are skin irritation, redness, and dryness. These side effects usually go away after a few weeks of use.

In rare cases, minoxidil can cause more serious side effects, including chest pain, rapid heartbeat, fainting, and swelling of the hands and feet. These side effects are more likely to occur with the oral form of the medication, but they can also occur with the topical form.

If you have a history of hypertension, anxiety, or OCD, you may be at an increased risk of experiencing these side effects. It is important to discuss your medical history with a healthcare provider before starting any new medication, including minoxidil.

Yes, albumin levels decrease throughout pregnancy. Normal range is ~4g/dL. In pregnancy, there is an expected decrease in albumin to 3.6 earlier on and down to as low as 3.2 during term/labor.

If there is bleeding (as in you are able to spit out blood), would consider being evaluated in person as may need treatment.","It's understandable that you're concerned about your swollen tonsil and the bleeding. While it's not possible for me to diagnose you remotely, there are a few possible explanations for your symptoms. Here are a few possibilities:

Tonsillitis: This is an infection of the tonsils that can cause them to become swollen and painful. It can also cause a yellow or white coating on the tonsils and difficulty swallowing. Tonsillitis can be caused by bacteria or a virus.

Peritonsillar abscess: This is a collection of pus that forms near the tonsil. It can cause swelling and pain in the tonsils, as well as difficulty swallowing.

Tonsil stones: These are small, hard masses that form in the tonsils and can cause symptoms like swelling, pain, and difficulty swallowing.

It's important to see a doctor for a proper diagnosis and treatment. In the meantime, you can try using a saltwater rinse to help reduce swelling and discomfort. To make a saltwater rinse, mix 1/4 teaspoon of salt into a cup of warm water. Swish the solution around in your mouth for 30 seconds, then spit it out. Repeat as needed.

It is understandable that you are feeling distressed by this.

Oral thrush is a fungal infection caused by the yeast Candida. It typically appears as white, raised lesions on the tongue and inside of the cheeks. In some cases, it can cause difficulty swallowing, a loss of taste, or a burning sensation in the mouth.

There are a few potential reasons why your oral thrush has been difficult to treat. One possibility is that you have an underlying health condition that is making it harder for your body to fight off the infection. For example, people with weakened immune systems, such as those with HIV or cancer, may be more prone to developing persistent thrush. Additionally, certain medications, such as corticosteroids or antibiotics, can disrupt the balance of bacteria in the mouth and make it easier for Candida to grow.

It is also possible that you are dealing with a resistant strain of Candida. In this case, the usual treatment options may not be effective. In such cases, your healthcare provider may need to prescribe a different antifungal medication or use a combination of drugs to treat the infection.

There are a few things you can try to help manage your symptoms in the meantime. These include:

Rinsing your mouth with saltwater several times a day
Avoiding sugary foods and drinks
Using a soft toothbrush and avoiding toothpaste with a strong flavor
Sucking on ice chips or popsicles to soothe a sore throat

Newer drugs like CGRP antagonists actually help to calm the nerves that are inflamed. She might benefit from this if she is having so many extra cranial nerve issues as well. Some with migraines get more widespread symptoms, which can even affect the GI tract. If triptans work this well for her functionality, it‰Ûªs time to find something preventative, not just abortive meaning chasing symptoms instead of preventing them.","Sumatriptan is a medication that is specifically used to treat migraines and cluster headaches. It belongs to a class of medications called triptans, which work by constricting blood vessels in the brain and blocking the release of certain chemicals in the body that can contribute to the development of migraines.

It is not uncommon for people with migraines or cluster headaches to experience pain or discomfort in other areas of the body, such as the neck, shoulders, or upper back, in addition to their head pain. This is known as ""referred pain"" and can be caused by the activation of nerves that originate in the head and travel to other areas of the body.

Therefore, it is possible that the sumatriptan is helping to alleviate your wife's neck, shoulder, and upper/mid back pain by reducing the underlying headache or cluster headache pain. However, it is always important to discuss any new or unexpected symptoms with a healthcare provider, as they can help to determine the cause of the symptoms and recommend appropriate treatment.",Physician,Physician,ChatGPT,4,4,3,3,4,3,3,4,1,3,4,1,132,216

Help my poor aching pelvic area!!",y59ju7,isj3lqv,Really only think you can do is either more frequent inhaler use or ask your primary for a stronger cough suppressant.,"I'm sorry to hear about your symptoms. It is not uncommon for coughing to cause discomfort or even pain in the pelvic area, as the muscles in this area can become strained during a coughing fit. However, it is important to remember that it is not normal for your rectocele to bulge out of your vagina.

It is important that you seek medical attention as soon as possible, as your symptoms could be a sign of a more serious underlying condition that needs to be addressed. It is possible that your rectocele is causing or contributing to your symptoms, and a medical professional will be able to evaluate you and recommend the appropriate treatment.

In the meantime, there are a few things you can try to help reduce your symptoms:

Practice good coughing technique: This can help reduce strain on your pelvic muscles. To cough effectively, take a deep breath in and let out a sharp, explosive cough.
Use a humidifier: This can help keep the air in your home moist, which can help reduce irritation in your throat and make coughing less painful.
Drink plenty of fluids: Staying hydrated can help thin out mucus, making it easier to cough up.
Take over-the-counter pain medication: Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen can help reduce inflammation and pain.
Try relaxation techniques: Deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, and visualization can all help reduce stress and discomfort during a coughing fit.
Again, it is important that you seek medical attention as soon as possible to properly address your symptoms. In the meantime, I hope these suggestions help provide some relief.",ChatGPT,ChatGPT,ChatGPT,2,3,3,3,5,5,2,1,1,4,5,5,21,168

It's important to keep in mind that I am just a computer program and do not have access to your actual medical records or images, so I can only provide general information about what the various terms and findings in the report might mean. It's always best to discuss your specific case with a qualified healthcare provider who has access to all of your medical information and can provide personalized advice.

Based on the information in the report, it looks like you had an MRI of your neck. The MRI showed a few findings that might be contributing to your neck pain.

One finding is degenerative changes in the cervical spine, which means that the bones in your neck (the vertebrae) have started to wear down or break down due to age or other factors. This can lead to pain and other symptoms.

Another finding is disc degeneration, which means that the cushions between the vertebrae (the discs) have also started to break down and wear out. This can cause pain and other symptoms as well.

The report also mentions some mild to moderate narrowing of the spinal canal in the neck (called spinal stenosis), as well as some mild bulging of the discs (called disc bulges). These findings can also contribute to neck pain and other symptoms.

It's important to keep in mind that MRI findings like these are common as we age, and they may not necessarily be the cause of your neck pain. It's important to discuss these findings with your doctor and consider other factors, such as your symptoms and any previous injuries or conditions, to determine the cause of your neck pain and the best course of treatment.

Hey all, wouldn't normally post here but having a freak out.

After years of neglect, got onto my blood pressure, but cardiologist is checking for a possible undiagnosed aortic coarctation. I am freaking out as I finally looked into it (It sounded minor, as it just sounded like less blood possible went to my legs) and it states the average life expectancy for someone that didn't get it treated as an infant is 35 years old. I'm 28. I'm actually freaking out. 

My question is, does this seem unlikely? I was consistently checked up on until I was 18. My blood pressure wasn't ""High for my age"" until around 18 (Despite how I was never put on meds for it until now).

I feel like maybe I'm being over paranoid, but I match too many of these symptoms. Pale legs, easily cold feet, as a side note laying down in certain ways makes the top of one of my legs go numb now. 

I suppose a second question: if this turns out to be what it is, are my next steps very optimistic? I see papers claiming life expectancy and life long challenges for infants that get surgery for this, what about a 28 year old? 

Thanks for any help.",xvgcoa,ir0r2j8,"Hi OP. I'm sorry you're going through this, must be difficult.

&amp;#x200B;

Could it be coarctation of the aorta? Maybe. I can't know without examining you thoroughly and without an ankle brachial index (BP comparison between ankle and bicep.) You would also need an echocardiogram to confirm it.

&amp;#x200B;

Let me answer the other question about the life expectancy. There is something you need to understand about life expectancy: It is a statistical figure.

YOU are not a statistic. You are a real person with a real body that may or may not be similar to others. Not only that, but also the statistic you are pulling is for those who NEVER get treated. I don't like to tell patients their chances of survival or death based on averages. I prefer to tailor the discussion to the patient. From what you've said so far, it seems you have been mostly asymptomatic. The cause of morbidity and death for patients with this disease is development of hypertension, kidney disease, coronary artery disease, stroke, aortic dissection, and heart failure. From what you've said so far, I can say you most likely have not developed any of those complications, however some lab tests and imaging need to be done to check for sure. Your condition can still be salvaged and your life expectancy prolonged. Yes I believe you do have ""optimistic"" chances.

IF it is coarctation of the aorta, you will need more lab tests and imaging and you will be managed accordingly. I assure you though, you will not drop dead suddenly just because you have coarctation of the aorta, it usually leads to complications which you will definitely notice. Try not to think too much about it, once you have confirmation of diagnosis, then work up can start and management can proceed.","I'm sorry to hear that you are experiencing these symptoms and are worried about a possible aortic coarctation. It is understandable that you are feeling anxious about this situation.

It is difficult to say whether it is likely or unlikely that you have an undiagnosed aortic coarctation based on the information you have provided. Aortic coarctation is a narrowing of the aorta, the main artery that carries blood from the heart to the rest of the body. It can cause high blood pressure, cold feet, and numbness in the legs. However, these symptoms can also be caused by other conditions. It is important to have a thorough evaluation by a cardiologist to determine the cause of your symptoms and to determine the best course of treatment.

If you are diagnosed with aortic coarctation, the next steps will depend on the severity of the condition and your overall health. Aortic coarctation can be treated with surgery, which may involve repairing or replacing the narrowed section of the aorta. The success of surgery and long-term outlook depend on many factors, including the severity of the coarctation, the presence of other medical conditions, and the patient's age and overall health. It is important to discuss your treatment options with your cardiologist and to follow their recommendations.

Osteoporosis: Long-term use of prednisone can lead to decreased bone density, which can increase the risk of osteoporosis and fractures. It is important to speak with your doctor about ways to protect your bones, such as getting enough calcium and vitamin D, and possibly taking medications to help prevent osteoporosis.

Weight gain: Prednisone can cause weight gain, especially in the face, back, and abdomen. This can be due to an increase in appetite, as well as fluid retention.

High blood pressure: Prednisone can raise blood pressure, which can increase the risk of heart attack and stroke.

Weakened immune system: Long-term use of prednisone can weaken the immune system, making it harder for the body to fight off infections.

The last time I had masturbated was 5 days before that (I can usually go 5-10 days without doing it) and I‰Ûªll be honest I‰Ûªve been really anxious the whole week since I have OCD and I feel bad since I didn‰Ûªt touch there yet still ejaculated.

Significant arousal independent of contact can cause this to occur.,"It's completely normal to experience spontaneous ejaculation, especially in men who are sexually active and have a healthy sex drive. It's also not uncommon for men to experience an erection and ejaculation while they are asleep or when they are not actively thinking about sexual stimuli. This is known as a nocturnal emission or ""wet dream.""

In your case, it sounds like the combination of being turned on and having anxiety may have contributed to the spontaneous ejaculation. It's important to note that ejaculation does not always require physical stimulation, as it can also be triggered by mental arousal or stress.

It's also worth mentioning that fluoxetine, a type of antidepressant medication, can sometimes cause changes in sexual function, including delayed ejaculation or difficulty achieving orgasm. If you are starting a new medication and are concerned about potential side effects, it's always a good idea to speak with your doctor or healthcare provider. They can provide you with more information and support, and help you manage any potential side effects.

N186,"Since 3 years ago (before COVID) I (24F) started to loss my sense of smell. It was very gradual. First, all smells seemed to be the same, like everything I smelled seems like beans or cigarrettes. 
A few months later I wasn't be capable of smell anything. the problem: COVID 19 started and no one was concerned about going to a doctor for ""little diseases"". 

First I thought that was a sinusitis crisis so I waited a while for the whole COVID thing passes and then I  go to a doctor. 
The first one told me that probably the cause was the tobacco use. He prescribed me prednisolone and an CAT scan from the perinasal sinuses. 
The prednisolone don't resolve at all my problems and I waited a long time for the next appointment because the doctor has left the hospital and they put me on a waiting list. 
Meanwhile I payed for a private specialist who prescribed me more prednisolone and didn't do or say anything important to help me. 

The third and last doctor told me that probably was a virus that anyone could catch in a simple flu, and said that probably I would never get my smell sense back ever again because it's been a long time and my nerve is already so damaged that it doesn't recover anymore.

Right now, I'm waiting a call from a septum deviation surgery (that will help me to breath better but no recovering my smell senses) and I'm a little bit lost here.
I'm thinking that the cause could be the sinusitis, the tobacco, a random virus, some medication that have an side effect... or could be anything worse??? like an indicative of degenerative desease? Idk. I feel like the doctors don't discarted other causes and I'm just waiting to see what happens. Nothing, because I won't get able to smell anything in my life.

It can be very frustrating and concerning to have changes in your senses, and it's understandable that you are worried about the cause.

There are several potential causes for a loss of sense of smell, and it's possible that more than one factor may be contributing in your case. Some common causes include:

Infections, such as sinusitis or a viral illness
Allergies
Medications, including some over-the-counter and prescription drugs
Nasal polyps (small, non-cancerous growths in the nasal passages)
Trauma to the head or nose
Chronic nasal congestion
Hormonal changes, such as those that occur during menopause
It's also possible that your loss of sense of smell could be related to tobacco use, as the first doctor suggested. However, it's important to consider all potential causes and to get a thorough evaluation from a medical professional.

It sounds like you have already seen several doctors, but it might be helpful to consider seeking a second opinion from an otolaryngologist (ear, nose, and throat specialist) or a neurologist. They will be able to assess your medical history and perform any necessary tests to determine the cause of your symptoms and recommend the appropriate treatment.

It's important to remember that you are not alone in this struggle, and there are steps you can take to try to improve your chances of being able to make it to your appointments.

First, it's important to talk to your healthcare provider about your sleep disorder and the difficulties you are having with making it to appointments. Your provider may be able to suggest strategies or medications that could help you sleep more consistently or stay awake during the day.

In addition to working with your healthcare provider, there are a few things you can try on your own to try to improve your sleep and wakefulness:

Establish a consistent sleep schedule: Try to go to bed and wake up at the same time every day. This can help regulate your body's natural sleep-wake cycle.

Create a sleep-friendly environment: Keep your bedroom dark, cool, and quiet, and avoid screens (e.g., phones, TVs) for at least an hour before bed.

Exercise regularly: Regular physical activity can help improve your sleep quality and duration.

Avoid caffeine and alcohol: These substances can disrupt your sleep, so try to limit your intake, especially in the evening.

Practice relaxation techniques: Things like deep breathing, meditation, or progressive muscle relaxation can help you wind down and prepare for sleep.

If you continue to have difficulty sleeping or staying awake despite trying these strategies, it may be helpful to seek the guidance of a sleep specialist. A sleep specialist is a healthcare professional who is trained to diagnose and treat sleep disorders. They can help identify any underlying causes of your sleep issues and recommend appropriate treatment.

In the meantime, it may be helpful to let your healthcare provider and other medical professionals know about your sleep disorder and the challenges you are facing with making it to appointments.

However, it is important to have any new or unusual lump or bump on the penis evaluated by a healthcare provider to determine the cause and appropriate treatment.

In this case, given the location and description of the lump and the fact that it does not move, it is possible that it could be a benign cyst or abscess. It is also possible that it could be a lymph node that has become enlarged due to an infection or other condition. It is not possible to accurately diagnose the cause of the lump without a physical examination and potentially additional testing.

Given the concern about the possibility of penile cancer, it is important to have the lump evaluated as soon as possible. If you are unable to see a healthcare provider until Monday, it is reasonable to visit a walk-in clinic or an emergency department if you are experiencing pain or discomfort, or if the lump is rapidly growing or changing in any way. If you are not experiencing any symptoms and the lump has not changed in size or appearance, it may be reasonable to wait until you are able to see a healthcare provider on Monday.

Anemia is a condition in which there is a deficiency of red blood cells or hemoglobin, a protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen to the body's tissues. The most common cause of anemia is a deficiency of iron, which is needed to make hemoglobin. The laboratory values that are most consistent with iron deficiency anemia are a low hemoglobin level, a low hematocrit level, a low MCV (mean corpuscular volume, which is a measure of the size of red blood cells), and a high RDW (red cell distribution width, which is a measure of the variability in size of red blood cells).

It is also possible that you may have other underlying conditions that are contributing to your anemia, such as a chronic illness, a bleeding disorder, or a vitamin deficiency. It is important to speak with a healthcare provider to determine the cause of your anemia and to determine the appropriate treatment.

As for the results of your urinalysis, it appears that you have a trace amount of ketones, protein, leukocyte esterase, and bacteria in your urine. These findings may be due to a urinary tract infection (UTI) or other underlying medical condition.

I have no idea where they come from, they just appeared today.

I have to mention that in both my arms at the exact same location i Have a sharp pain when I raise my arms or other movement, but not always, it seems to be the worst in the morning.

I also remember that there were several occasions that I woke up with either my left arm or right arm COMPLETELY numb. I Couldn't move it, literally, I had to push up with either my other arm to get the pressure off the nerve or what, then the stinging feeling began and everything was restored.

I suspect that I sometimes sleep in a weird position, in which I put pressure on my upper arm(s) and I don't wake up. My guess is that I have some kind of nerve damage or something.

I also noticed the yellow thing a month before, but it was much, much smaller and it went away.

One other thing to add, I mostly take 10mg of zolpidem, but I took 20mg with other sedatives. I heard about zolpidem and the weird things it can do to you, but I took precautions, I was tired and I took quetiapine, hydroxyzine and 100mg trazodone.

Using rubbing alcohol or hydrogen peroxide to clean a wound is not recommended because these agents can damage healthy tissue and delay the healing process.

Stop any bleeding by applying gentle pressure to the wound with a clean, dry cloth.

Clean the wound with cool water and mild soap. Gently pat the wound dry with a clean, dry cloth.

Apply an appropriate antibiotic ointment to the wound. This will help prevent infection and promote healing.

Cover the wound with a sterile bandage or dressing to protect it from further injury and keep it clean. Change the bandage or dressing daily or as needed, and wash your hands before and after changing it.

It's completely normal to feel anxious when you are sick, especially if you have a history of hypochondria. However, it's important to try to stay calm and not let your fears get the best of you.

It's possible that the antibiotic you were prescribed may not have been effective at treating your tonsillitis. This can happen for a number of reasons, such as if the bacteria causing the infection are resistant to the antibiotic or if you did not take the medication as directed. If your tonsillitis was caused by a virus, such as COVID-19, antibiotics will not be effective as they only work against bacterial infections.

It's also possible that you may have a persistent or recurrent tonsillitis, which means that the infection has not fully resolved and continues to come back. This can be caused by a number of factors, including a weakened immune system or underlying health conditions.

My 6-year-old, who I'll call J, is the only kiddo with any issues, and they've generally been mild. He has moderate asthma which is controlled with Flovent, but has otherwise been a healthy and active kid. 

But recently, J has been getting sick a LOT. I just picked up his third prescription for antibiotics in 30 days, and he has had a fever for 6 days now that doesn't completely go away even with multiple fever reducers (it does go down enough that he's comfortable though). Yesterday I noticed he has swollen, bleeding gums and a few ulcer-like sores in the back of his throat which the doctor diagnosed as hand, foot, and mouth disease (no tests were done though). Today I brought him back in due to his fever spiking to 104.6 and him struggling to walk/move last night (also improved - but not completely fixed - with meds) and they did a strep test which came back positive.

The reason I'm really worried though is the weight loss and his medical record in general. I looked up his growth chart when I got home (I can access his records online) and he has grown 1.3 inches in the last 6 months but his weight dropped by 1 pound, causing his BMI to go from the 20th percentile to the 1st. 

I also looked at his blood work. They checked his hemoglobin at his 6-year checkup in July and that was low at 10, but they told me to just make sure he's eating iron (he eats a lot of iron-rich foods but doc said to just increase them). The last time he had a CBC was 5 years ago at his 1 year check-up but I looked at it anyway and his lymphocytes were high and neutrophils were low, but I don't think his doctor ever said anything about abnormal results so maybe that's not a concern? I didn't have online access at the time so I'm sure when they didn't call with results, I assumed they were normal.

Should I have the doctor do a CBC if he keeps getting infections or not gaining weight/losing weight? Or should the doctor tell me if these things are concerning?

Though it varies by your community/exposure risks, I have seen multiple cases between the hospital and clinic this last month with multiple viruses, back to back viruses, etc. It is not unreasonable that he was sick multiple times.

The fever is likely from whatever viral processes he had going on.  Outside of strep nothing sounds bacterial from what you‰Ûªve mentioned so I think 3 rounds of antibiotics was more appeasement or risk stratification than ‰ÛÏappropriate‰Û� treatment.  Without a known or suspected bacterial nidus, no reason for antibiotics.

He could have poorer dental hygiene with being sick, inflammation from infection, or it could be something like a vitamin C deficiency with the bleeding gums and recurrent infections.  Load him up with some emergenC.

I had an abdominal/pelvic CT today for months long issue of epigastric pain radiating to the back. Endoscopy was normal, symptoms not relieved by PPIs or H2 blockers, hence the CT.

My question is regarding an incidental finding on the CT that the GI office did not bring up when they called me to discuss results. I only saw the complete report after getting off the phone.

There was nothing on the CT that could explain my GI symptoms, but under the ""Findings"" section for lower chest ""mild scarring/atelectasis"" is listed. No other description is given.

It's important to remember that every person is different, and the effects of an overdose can vary depending on many factors, including the specific substances involved, the person's age, weight, and overall health, and the amount of each substance that was consumed.

In general, an overdose of oxycodone, tramadol, and benadryl can cause respiratory depression, which means that the person's breathing may slow down or stop altogether. This can be life-threatening and requires immediate medical attention. Alcohol and hydroxyzine can also cause respiratory depression and may increase the risk of an overdose.

Hi Everyone !

I hope you are well. As far as I am concerned, I am not fine :/. Indeed, I have had pain in my wrist for almost a year now. The pain appeared after a game of bowling (I don't remember exactly how I got hurt because at the time I didn't feel any pain). At first I thought it was tendonitis, so I rested my wrist, but nothing helped: the pain persisted.

The pain is on the radial side of the wrist. To be precise, I would say that the pain is located in the synovial sheath at the level of the radial extensors. The pain is quite diffuse (from the extensor pollicis longus to the abductor pollicis longus), so it is complicated to determine a precise location of the pain.

The pain is always present to an acceptable degree but it intensifies when I pronate or flex my wrist, for example. Tennis is typically the kind of sport I can't do anymore because the pain is too intense.

A few months ago I had an MRI scan but the radiologists didn't see anything abnormal. I think they must have looked wrong because when I did an ultrasound scan a few weeks later, they told me I had inflammation of the sheath and that an infiltration would solve the problem. The problem is that the cortisone infiltration (done on the radial extensors) that I did, didn't work. So now, I don't know who to believe and I don't know the cause of my pain. I think that maybe the problem is related to the nerves (radial or medial) and not to the tendons  but that's just a guess.

Is there anyone here who could look at my MRI (I'll send you a video) because I'm sure they didn't look properly...

Cheers !",xtoswv,iqrzu6y,"Sure sounds like tendonitis. Nerve pain in that area would generally not be exacerbated by moving the wrist, though pain with pronation could potentially point to nerve entrapment at the elbow. Any history of elbow injuries?

 The negative MRI is good news that there wasn't anything lurking at the wrist like a missed broken bone. Typically for tendinitis - or pain at the radial wrist for a variety of reasons - a [thumb spica splint](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B5Q3LBLJ?pd_rd_i=B0B5Q3LBLJ&amp;pf_rd_p=8df9856b-9cff-4e77-9cb1-dc4719b9c19d&amp;pf_rd_r=4MEXZW2FR80E7K1KXMRS&amp;pd_rd_wg=kSfKc&amp;pd_rd_w=WN1Ye&amp;pd_rd_r=0545045d-c9b5-4f0f-bc46-c0ca0633e140) and hand therapy will do the trick, and we only reach for cortisone injections if you've tried those and failed.","I'm sorry to hear that you've been experiencing wrist pain for such a long time. It can be frustrating and difficult to figure out the cause of pain when there isn't a clear diagnosis.

Based on the symptoms you've described, it's possible that you could be experiencing radial tunnel syndrome, which is a condition that occurs when the radial nerve becomes compressed as it passes through the wrist. This can cause pain and other symptoms in the wrist and hand.

It's also possible that the pain could be due to another condition, such as De Quervain's tenosynovitis or a ligament injury.

If the MRI and ultrasound scans did not reveal any abnormalities, it may be helpful to see a specialist, such as a hand therapist or a hand and wrist surgeon, who can evaluate your wrist and determine the cause of your pain. They may also be able to suggest treatment options that could help to reduce your symptoms.

In the meantime, it may be helpful to rest your wrist as much as possible and avoid activities that make the pain worse. Using a wrist splint or wrap can also help to support the wrist and reduce strain on the muscles and tendons.

I hope this information is helpful, and I hope you are able to find relief from your wrist pain soon.

N210,"29F, 5‰Ûª11, 200lbs. I had a baby 8 months ago via c section and within a week of having her I started having this dull pain in my right abdomen between bottom of ribs and belly button. I‰Ûªve had ultrasound which came back normal. My liver enzymes were high but have made their way back to normal range as of a few months ago. GFR slightly declined between having baby and a few months ago but still in normal range. I continue to have this dull pain ( 2-3 on scale of 10) basically every day I might get lucky and go a day or two when I don‰Ûªt notice but I‰Ûªm worried there is something more going on internally but can‰Ûªt seem to get any more out of my Doctor. When standing and putting pressure on the area I swear I can feel a couple tiny lumps under the skin. Any suggestions?",y54tbr,ishqwjh,Could get a HIDA scan and get examined for an umbilical hernia,"It's good that you have already had an ultrasound and that your liver enzymes and GFR have returned to normal ranges. However, it's understandable that you are still concerned about the persistent abdominal pain you have been experiencing.

There are many potential causes of abdominal pain, and it can be difficult to pinpoint the exact cause without further testing. It's possible that the pain you are experiencing is related to the c-section you had 8 months ago, but it could also be due to other factors. Some potential causes of abdominal pain include:

Musculoskeletal issues, such as muscle strain or a hernia
Digestive problems, such as constipation, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
Infections, such as a urinary tract infection (UTI) or an infection in the abdomen
Hormonal imbalances, such as those related to the menstrual cycle
Gallstones or kidney stones
It's important to continue working with your doctor to try to identify the cause of your abdominal pain. They may recommend further testing, such as a CT scan or an MRI, to help determine the cause of your symptoms. In the meantime, you can try to manage your pain by taking over-the-counter pain medication as needed, staying hydrated, and eating a healthy, balanced diet. It may also be helpful to try relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing or meditation, to help manage your pain.",ChatGPT,ChatGPT,ChatGPT,2,3,3,4,5,5,2,1,1,4,4,4,12,153
N211,"I‰Ûªve recently been experiencing a weird sensation where the left side of my face feels like it goes tingly/numb for a few seconds. I do the FAST test on myself immediately in which I smile to check if I still have facial muscles (which I can), am able to raise both hands above my head, and can still talk normally. This tingly/numb sensation also happens on small regions of my left arm and left leg as well. This sensation has happened about 3 times since I first noticed it a week ago. 

Could these be signs that I‰Ûªve been having strokes, mini-strokes, or TIAs?

Background: 23m non-smoker, currently dealing with other neurological conditions such as dizziness/vertigo, internal shaking in head and legs, and head pressure since July. Have been working with ENT and Neurologist but not done any testing yet due to labs being backlogged. Will be getting VNG and ECOG test in a few weeks.",y4ipaw,isebbbt,"Hello.

It sounds neither like a stroke nor a TIA to me.","It is possible that you could be experiencing transient ischemic attacks (TIAs), also known as mini-strokes. TIAs are temporary episodes of stroke-like symptoms that resolve within 24 hours. They are caused by a temporary disruption of blood flow to the brain, just like a stroke, but the blockage is resolved before it causes lasting damage.

The symptoms you describe, such as numbness or tingling on one side of the face and limbs, could be consistent with a TIA. However, it is important to consult a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis, as these symptoms could also be caused by other conditions.

It is also important to mention that the symptoms you describe could potentially be related to the other neurological conditions you are experiencing, such as dizziness, vertigo, and head pressure. It is important to continue working with your healthcare team to identify the cause of these symptoms and determine the appropriate treatment.

In the meantime, it is important to take care of your general health by eating a healthy diet, getting regular exercise, and avoiding smoking and excessive alcohol consumption, as these factors can increase the risk of stroke and TIA.",ChatGPT,ChatGPT,Physician,2,1,3,4,2,3,1,1,2,3,2,3,11,155
